# UniversalMayhemV2.7-1988
Version 2.7, 1998 -- 1996, C Universal Mayhem, the BBS game that was very popular from 1986 to about 1996, running on thousands of computer systems, one of the first on-line multi-player games before the DARPANet became the Internet. Later versions exist but I can't not find them.
