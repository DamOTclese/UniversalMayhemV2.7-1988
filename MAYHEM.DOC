Author Access  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 01.00.00.00.00

   The author of Universal Mayhem, The C version, would like to retain
   total contact with both the System Operators who maintain the game
   and the users who play it. Because of this, the author has placed
   himself into a highly visible condition by offering complete
   support at no cost to the public domain. This includes the mailing
   of Universal Mayhem, the C version, updates, and support either by
   telephone or by United States mail.

   This attitude and posture was developed for a variety of reasons.
   The public ones have been described before in FidoNews so I will not
   repeat them in great detail. The major reason for distributing
   Universal Mayhem across the FidoNet community for no charge is to
   promote the good will of the net and to provide a forum in which
   hostilities may be vent through symbolic means.

   As always, Universal Mayhem is Public Domain and NO "company" which
   steals from the Public Domain and sells my software, even at cost,
   will NOT be tolerated. Pick it up freely and pass it on freely.

   There is an initial release notice that players will NEVER see. This
   is because the displayed notice does not go through the modem, even
   when output is redirected. This notice should never be edited out of
   the executable. Indeed, if an attempt is made to edit even one
   character of the release notice, Universal Mayhem will detect the
   tampering and erase all Universal Mayhem files. In addition, you
   get a nasty notice before returning to DOS, (see section
   01.03.00.01.00).

Mailing address  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 01.01.00.00.00

   United States Mail. What can I say? You can still send a letter to
   any place in the states for some .25 cents. That's quite a good
   price, if you think about it. The problems arise when you really
   want to get your hands on some good software and have to wait for
   two or more days to get it.

   In any event, if you would like to be placed on the distribution
   mailing list, or would simply like to converse by written media,
   here is my mailing address:

   Fredric L. Rice
   Universal Mayhem
   674 East Bridwell
   Glendora, California.

Privileges . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 01.03.00.00.00

   The author _DOES_ have some special privileges that are not going
   to be made accessible to the call-up user. Indeed, the System
   Operator has TOTAL control over everything Universal Mayhem the C
   version, (UMC), does.

   --- Version 1.5 Notes:

   There is no more shelling to DOS from a remote system. Since the Mayhem
   program does it's own redirection now, the shell would cause the local
   system to not perform any redirection, making the program shell, but
   without the remote system being able to see anything or enter anything.

Business Cards . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 01.03.01.00.00

   When you become a Universal Mayhemite, ask for business cards. I will
   mail you some cards free of charge for you to hand to your players. The
   cards don't offer players anything other than a neat card to have
   that shows they are members of the Universal Mayhem killer team!

Self defense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 01.03.00.01.00

   When Universal Mayhem loads, the SysOp will see a notice dealing with
   copyrights. As a method of self defense against having this message
   removed, (which the user never sees), or altered, Universal Mayhem will
   detect any modifications to its strings and finding any, will remove
   all _Mayhem_ files it can find. It will then print a nasty message and
   then terminates.

   There is no reason why Mayhem can't be reinstalled from the original
   archive file or distribution diskette, however, so the punitive measure
   of having it remove itself is almost worthless.

   What I considered doing was to have it remove all .EXE and .COM files
   along with any .BBS files it could find. This would not have been in
   keeping with Fidonet spirit so I have it remove only my files. Not only
   that but a corrupted file could cause the checksums to not match. In
   any event, nothing bad will happen...

Thanks, everyone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 01.03.00.01.01

   [On soap box]

   It's unbelievable the good will of the people you meet in the electronic
   computer board media. The system operators and the end users all assisted
   in the development of this game and provided the lions share of testing.
   They still do.

   It was they who had to contend with the system crashes which tied up the
   computer until they got home, not me. It was also they who considered the
   possibilities of the game rather than dropping it entirely when they came
   home to find it locked up. They also spent thousands of dollars, all told,
   to report bugs and acquire the latest updates. All over the world, they
   wrote, offering return postage to test my game. Or to offer simple praise.

   Well, version 1.40 represents the first real release version of Universal
   Mayhem. There have been many systems that ran Universal Mayhem in the
   past three years. Few of those remain and are replaced by systems that
   are compatible to the older version 1.30. Beta tests are over, the Mayhem
   truly begins.

   This game has represented a major factor in my life for the past three
   years; it continue to do so. You, as the user, and you as the system
   operator, have my word that no reported bug will go un-repaired. No question
   will go unanswered. And no suggestion will be dismissed out of hand.

Version Update Pointers <--------------------------------- 01.03.01.01.00

   Through out this document, you will notice things that look like:

   --- Version 1.00 Note:

   This points to an area of the documentation that shows an update
   that is of interest to SysOps who have already seen the older versions
   of the documentation. A text editor being used to find these pointers
   for faster information on new features was the reason these pointers
   were put in.

Commands . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.00.00.00.00

   The various commands that are allowed are described:

Entering them  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.00.01.00.00

   While entering anything into Universal Mayhem, if you don't do anything
   within three minutes, you will get a warning. The terminal will beep a
   few times and display a warning.

   After an additional minute, you will be bounced out to the BBS software.
   If the BBS software used a smart batch file to call Universal Mayhem, it
   will check for an errorlevel of 42 and bypass the BBS altogether,
   resetting the system, rather than returning you to it to await an
   additional time out.

   For additional information, see the errorlevels described towards the
   end of the document.

   One other thing that was added to Universal Mayhems keyboard/com port
   entry routine: If you enter a command and don't want to hit a lot of
   backspaces to get rid of it all and start over, simply hit:

   CONTROL-X

Detailed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.00.00.00

   The Universal Mayhem game is run by having the player enter a
   series of commands at the game prompt. Actually, these commands may
   be strung together and run en mass.

A (again)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.01.00.00

   After entering a long string of commands, such as when you create
   a commerce loop where you buy things at low cost at one planet,
   warp to another planet, sell the things at high cost, and warp back
   to the original planet, you may not want to re-enter the command
   string again after it's completed its execution.

   Simply hit 'A' and then return and and the previous command string
   will be executed again. You may 'A'gain as many times as you wish.

AUCTION  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.02.00.00

   When you perform a 'NAMES' command, you may see some ships that
   have been impounded. This is because their ships captains were either
   unable to pay their taxes, or they were stupid and refused to pay
   their taxes.

   When taxes are due, the captain gets 10 sign-in warnings and then
   the ship is impounded. All of the cash on board, if any, is
   transferred to the Galactic Police and the ship remains at station
   until it's disposition is determined by the highest bidder.

   When you see a ship has been impounded, you may place a bid on the
   ship. The 'NAMES' command will also show you who else has bid on
   the ships. You may only bid on one ship at a time.

   When 'AUCTION' is performed, you will be offered a list of the
   ships that are available. If you want to bid on one, you must offer
   the number of the ship and then the amount of your bid. You may
   not place a bid on Fridays. This is because those ships that have
   bids outstanding are the only ships that are allowed to perform the
   AUCTION command on Friday.

   The way it works:

   Ships may place bids on impounded ships every day of the week except
   Fridays. On Fridays, those ships that have bids outstanding may check
   in to see if theirs was the highest bid. If so, all of the contents
   of the impounded ship gets transferred to the bidders ship. If the
   bid came in low, no funds are exchanged and the outstanding bid is
   removed and the captain may make another bid if desired.

   When the captain of a ship makes a bid, the Galactic Police will make
   sure that the captain has enough credits to cover the bid. If so,
   then the bid is allowed to progress. If on the following Friday the
   captain does not have enough cash to cover the bid and the bid is
   the winning bid, the captain still gets the contents of the ship but
   the remaining balance due to put into his taxes due.

   If that captain fails to pay the taxes, that ship will be impounded
   and put up for auction as well. It doesn't pay to bid billions and
   billions and then loose it all later.

   The starting bid is set at 1000 for all ships. A bid of less than this
   will not be accepted.

B (Buy)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.00.00

   You make money with which to buy power such that you may become
   invincible and become God. The buying and selling of items in a
   loop is called a "commerce loop" through out the context of this
   document.

   You buy things by offering a command that looks something like
   this:

   b2100

   This will buy 100 units of cargo. To see what can be bought, you may
   simply type a 'B' and hit enter at the game prompt. You may buy more
   than one item at a time by putting ; marks after buying commands:

   b11000;b44

   This will buy 1000 units of energy and a class 4 higher warp drive.
   The items that may be bough a numbered from 0 to 9 and A. You must
   have enough money to buy things and if you ever want to know the
   price of something, type 'INFO' after docking with a planet, (you
   have to dock with a planet before you may buy and sell things).

What can you buy?  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.00

Remote robot sensors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.01

   You may buy up to four Remote Robot Sensors. They offer a wide
   variety of possibilities that you might find interesting. Some of the
   more interesting aspects of remote robot sensors:

   o You place a remote near your base or a good commerce planet and
     warp across to the other side of the universe. You may take a sensor
     scan from that remote sensor to see what's in that area. Likewise,
     you may place a remote robot near an enemy base to keep an eye on it.

   o You may attach a remote robot sensor on an enemy ship. This is done
     by warping on top of the enemy ship and deploying the remote. When
     the enemy ship moves, the remote sticks to it, allowing you to always
     know where the ship is. You can perform a sensor scan from that remote
     robot sensor to find the ship and see what's around it, or simply
     request a STAT command to see the position of the attached remote.

   o You may send them into black holes and perform sensor scans of where
     they come out to see what's on the other side of the black hole. You
     are allowed to move the remote robots by radio even through black
     holes, (this is the SPY command).

   There are many other reasons for using remote robot sensors. They can
   also be placed on allied ships to keep an eye on them. This was an
   interesting aspect to the game that I hadn't thought about but was used
   by one of the players on the beta test version where I work. By
   attaching a remote onto an aggressive ship, keeping track of it, he would
   perform a STAT every now and then to see if the remote was coming
   closer to him. If it did, then the ship its attached to is under command
   file control and possible ATTACKing him. By STATing, then, he was
   able to know when to run for it.

Energy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.02

   Just about everything your ship does requires power. You may buy and
   sell power as needed but you must have enough power to operate your
   shields and warp drive when warping around.

   Shield power is used to defend your ship against enemy attack. When
   your ship is unattended, power is automatically diverted from your
   ships engines to your shields.

   --- Version 1.20 Note:

   It was suggested by Martin Lindquist (153/507) that power not be
   sell-able. This was a suggestion aimed towards making it a little
   harder to acquire a lot of cash quickly.

   Let's see how this works and if it's messy, we'll yank it out, get
   an air line ticket and snuff that bastard right out! (Chortle!)

Cargo  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.03

   Cargo is used simply as something to buy and sell to make credits.

Crew members . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.04

   Crew members come in handy and are needed on board for a variety of
   reasons. The least of which is running your ships functions. When you
   run out of crew members, you won't be able to operate life support or
   man shuttle crafts.

   In addition, when boarding enemy bases, you need a lot of crew members
   to fight off the resistance encountered on the enemy base, (if the
   enemy captain has manned the base.

Warp drive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.05

   You may operate a warp drive up to a class 50 warp. The class warp
   drive determines the maximum distance jump-able in one move. The
   reason that a class 50 is the maximum is because of the enormous
   amount of power required to jump as regards to lower to higher
   warp values.

   As progressively higher warps are encountered, the energy curve
   becomes bewildering. A warp speed of 50 is the theoretical limit as
   technology hits an impassable wall at this speed.

Shuttle transports . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.06

   Shuttles are needed to transport objects to and from orbit. If you
   don't have a shuttle, you will be charged extra for transport when
   you buy and sell things.

   In addition, shuttles are used as decoys when your ship is fighting
   unattended for you and things look grim. The higher class shuttle
   used as a decoy, the better and longer the attacking ship will be
   tied up shooting at your decoy and not looking for your ship.

Hull patches . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.07

   The ships hull can be fortified with metallic weave titanium hull
   patches. A STATus of the ship shows the percentage of hull integrity
   that your ship has.

   When your ship has run out of power and is being pounded on by an
   enemy ship, the hull is your ships last defense against intrusion. The
   crew may be all dead, but your ship _may_ survive for when you come
   back, (true, your ship will be adrift and powerless and you will
   probably have to destruct, but the enemy captain may be cheated of
   the kill).

   Your damage starts when the hull integrity slips below 100%.

Sensor devices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.08

   Sensors are very useful items. They allow the range of the sensor
   scan array to be extended based on the technology level.

   When you perform a FIND for planets, the distance of the find is
   determined by the sensors technology level. Likewise, when you perform
   a sensor scan, if your sensors class are greater or equal to any
   enemy ships in the area, you will be able to see them.

   If and enemy ships cloaking device technology is greater than your
   sensors technology, you will not be able to see them but the computer
   will report that there is an ion trail in the area.

Cloaking devices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.09

   See "sensor device", (02.01.03.01.08).

Torpedoes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.10

   You usually fill your ship with the maximum number of torpedoes and
   never sell them. You may sell them, but you don't want to get caught
   in a fight without them.

   They are used to attack and defend in battle. The strength of the
   hit value is determined by distance.

Attack sleds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.01.11

   Attack sleds are used to defend areas of space.

How do you buy?  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.03.02.00

   You check to see if you have enough cash by performing a "INFO"
   command after docking with a planet. This will tell you the cost of
   all the items.

   A "STAT" command will tell you how much cash you have. If you wanted
   to spend all of your money on power and don't want to compute how many
   units you can buy, you could make your buy a string command that looks
   something like this:

   b11000;rpt30

   This will buy 1000 units of power 30 times. If you run out of cash
   anywhere in this loop, you will be told "not enough credits" to buy
   the item. This will continue until the count of 30 is reached or you
   MAY HIT THE ESC key on your computer to cause the immediate termination
   of the repeat clause.

   If you are able to buy the 30000 units of power without exceeding the
   credits you have, then you can simply issue an "A" for "again" and
   you will then cause the re-execution of the previous command.

BASE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.04.00.00

   A base is useful for keeping things. Discover its uses. When your
   ship gets destroyed, your base will remain behind, allowing you to get
   back in when your ship is recreated, (in a crippled condition).

   In addition, if you are docked with your base and someone attacks you,
   the attacking ship must go through your base first to get to you.

Building a base  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.04.01.00

   You may build a base simply by warping to the location that you want
   the base and requesting the "BASE" command.

   The base will be built and you will be given a menu describing the
   ability to move items from your ship to your base, from your base to
   the ship; you may disassemble the base or move it if you wish.

Move supplies from ship to base  . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.04.02.00

   You can move power, cargo, crew, and cloaking devices to your base.
   There is no limit to the amount of items moved from ship to base.

Move supplies from base to ship  . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.04.03.00

   You can move things from your base to your ship. There are limits
   to what your ship can hold, remember, so if you exceed the maximum
   allowable space for cargo, it will be spaced.

   If you exceed the maximum number of crew members, they will be
   spaced as well in their underwear.

Dissassemblement of base . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.04.04.00

   You can disassemble the base so you may move it elsewhere if you wish.
   Keep in mind that your ship may not be able to contains everything in
   your base.

Repairing a damaged base . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.04.05.00

   If an enemy fires at your base after its shields were lowered, damage
   will have occurred. If the attacking ship did _not_ destroy it, you will
   need to either repair it or disassemble it and rebuild again.

   If you chose to repair it, you will need to pay the repair crew.

BOARD  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.05.00.00

   You may board an enemy ship or base. To do so, the ship or base must have
   had its shields lowered. You do this in a non-gentle manor by blasting
   away at it until it can't take no more.

   If you board a ship, the resistance you may encounter is practically
   non existent. They have taken a beating and will not fight as you swing
   aboard and dispatch any remaining survivors.

   Swinging aboard an enemy base, however, is a different story. The base
   is heavily insulated from torpedo attack and the crew, if any, will be
   more than willing to resist.

   In order to board an enemy base, you MUST have more crew members than the
   enemy base for your boarding party to win. Otherwise, your boarding crew
   will come back minus a lot of people.

   Simply remove the ship or bases shield and warp onto it. Then type "BOARD".

   There is another way you may board a base however it is for friendly
   refueling. To do this, you must make an alliance, (PEACE command), with a
   ships captain. That captain will need to make an alliance with you. You
   should agree in this either through subspace mail or if you ever happen
   to see the captain.

   When you have a mutual alliance, you may board each others bases without
   needing to remove the shields. When you type "BOARD", you will be given
   10% of everything on board. Every time you type BOARD. If you start to
   exceed what the owner of the base expects, or if you take it ALL, then
   that captain is more than justified to seek you out and destroy you!

   If you want to see who of your friends boarded your base, STAT will
   tell you the last person to off-load supplies from your base.

COMETS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.06.00.00

   Why not? The COMETS command will show you the location of the various
   comets that have been seen and reported throughout the universe. You
   will also be given the location of the heart of an ion field.

   If you ever see a comet, you are given a chance to name it. What fun!
   Anyway, a comet will show up when using SCAN as either O--- or as
   ---O.

COMMAND  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.00.00

   You are allowed to maintain a command file that helps to automate your
   ship while you are away. This aspect of Universal Mayhem is the
   primary reason for development of the C version over the older and less-
   capable BASIC version.

   In the command file you may maintain, you tell Universal Mayhem how to
   defend your ship and friends, and what to do about your enemies while
   you are not active. In addition, you also tell Universal Mayhem how to
   deal with battle conditions; when to bail-out of a fight.

ATTACK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.01.00

   If you wish, you may attack ships as soon as they sign in. This is
   somewhat of a difficult stance to take unless you are almost certain
   to win. There is a problem, of course, in that the active captain has
   the ability to refuel and rebuild in real time while your ship is not
   controlled with any real intelligence, (it can not warp onto a planet,
   dock, and buy power to fight with).

   Simply tell the Universal Mayhem program who to attack when they sign
   in. The "COMMAND" statement will list those ships that you currently
   want to attack and will ask you if you want to:

   o Add ships to the list of ships to attack

   o Remove an existing ship to attack from the command file

   o Quit back to Universal Mayhem prompt

   o Save the attack entries and move on to the DEFEND section

   It's important to note that you may specify "ALL" as the name of the
   ship to attack. When you do this, any ship that signs in will be
   attacked by your ship. This is useful when you are just looking for
   a fight to pick.

   When your ships command file is scanned after an enemy ship logs in,
   a block of data in RAM is set aside that is used in an interesting
   manor. Read "Other Information", (Appendages 00).

   When a ship is commanded to ATTACK the currently active ship, the warp
   drive capability is divided by four, making the attacking ship much
   slower, possibly, than the active ship. This is done for a reason.

   It seems that if ships gang up on a certain ship; all of them talk
   among themselves to rid the universe of a particular problem; the ship
   trying to defend itself is not able to get away from the pack. By
   dropping all ATTACKing ships warp capability, the active ship has a
   chance to run very fast in a direction and attempt to commerce before
   the enemy ships catch up.

Swarm attacks/defense . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.01.01

   If your ship is automated to warp into an area to attack or assist
   a ship, or if it comes in to assist your base, attack sleds which are
   in the area will attack your automated ship unless you have a mutual
   alliance.

   Let's say that you decided to attack "DUCK" whenever it signs in. Let's
   also say that DUCK is currently near his base where there are two
   planets DUCK uses for commerce.

   DUCK, being a smart captain, has created five attack swarms, one at
   each planet and three around the base. Your ship, when it catches up
   with DUCK; say in a commerce loop, will start to attack it. DUCKs swarms,
   however, will start to defend and fire back at your automated ship.
  
   If placed properly, DUCKs sleds will fight you at every de-warp station
   in the commerce loop, allowing DUCK to _perhaps_ retain a commerce loop
   without needing to run for it. When his sleds run out of power, however,
   your attacking ship will be allowed to battle DUCKs ship and base.

DEFEND . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.02.00

   Defend does not work. It's a bummer because it was supposed to allow
   your ship to warp into a battle and defend a ship if it gets attacked
   by the active ship.

   I can implement this aspect of Universal Mayhem, and I would really
   like to hear about it, by allocating another block of memory, actually
   an array, which would contain a matrix of those ships which wish to
   defend which ships. Actually, more I think about it, a linked list
   would take less space.

   The only problem with this is the memory would hardly ever be used
   to place the code in Universal Mayhem.

   --- Version 1.30 note:

   This _does_ work now though in a manor in which you may not like. If you
   say "defend" a ship, what will happen is this:

   If the ships you have a defend declarative outstanding for attacks
   anyone, your ship will attack the ship in your defend declarative,
   (which is the currently active ship).

ASSIST . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.03.00

   When you assist a captain, your ship will warp into a battle and
   start firing on the same ship that the active ship is attacking. I
   should word this better:

   If you tell Universal Mayhem to assist ship BARF, then any ship that
   BARF attacks will also be attacked by your ship. Keep in mind that
   your ship will also be attacked by the ship BARF if attacking.

   "ALL" will work if you want to assist everyone!

   --- Version 1.30 Note:

   Previous versions of this command declarative did not work. That was
   because I never really coded it. I forgot and simply put in some
   stubs for this routine; stubs that causes duplication of ships and
   removal of ships. Quite stupid. I could say that it was an oversight
   because of the complexity of the problem but that would be misleading.

   Now, if your ship assists the active ship in its fight, your ship can
   destroy the ship the active ship is destroying and take the prize from
   it! You can get all the planets the ship had and all the slaver death
   weapon parts it had, (if any).

   If your ship destroys a ship while assisting, your ship gets credited
   will the kill.

   Of course, if the ship the active ship attacks destroys you because
   you assisted the active ship, the ship that destroys you gets all
   of your planets, slaver death parts, and credit for the kill.

RUN-FROM . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.04.00

   If you want to have your ship run from a particular ship or "ALL",
   you may do so. The way this works is your ship will warp away from
   its location if an enemy ship gets too close.

   --- Version 1.30 Note: (Was initially released un-documented Vers. 1.20).

   The top three ships in the standings listing will have the run-from
   declarative suspended. This means that if your ship has a run-from
   command in it, your ship will _not_ run from anyone if your ship is
   one of the top three ships.

BAIL-OUT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.05.00

   If your ship is engaged in a battle, you may cause your ship to run
   away and attempt to hide by specifying various BAIL-OUT parameters.
   When your ship bails out, it will warp in a single direction for a
   random number of jumps at maximum warp.

   If your ship is found after bailing out, its no longer controlled by
   the command files and are subject to returning fire capabilities.

On Power . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.05.01

   You may bail out when your ships engines available power drops below
   a certain value. Keep in mind that your ship is going to need power
   to run on if it must bail out.

On Torpedo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.05.02

   You may bail-out when your ships torpedoes run out. Keep in mind that
   if your ship is found again, it's going to need to try to defend
   itself.

On Time Remaining  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.05.03

   If the amount of time left for the player is about to become too low,
   such as perhaps five minutes left, you can bail out. This is useful
   when you want to do battle but don't want to be around when the enemy
   captain signs in only to find you sitting off his starboard side.

On Damage Received . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.05.04

   Your ship can perform a bail-out whenever it receives damage. At the
   first sign of damage, your ship will attempt to run from the attacking
   ship. You can only hope that the aggressor will not be able to find
   you again.

Decoy .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.05.05

   One interesting aspect of Universal Mayhems COMMAND files is the
   ability to drop a decoy shuttle before a bail out. This is done by
   specifying a class shuttle to drop just before running.

   On the sensor scan, the shuttle will return a scan that looks just
   like your ship. When the attacking ship fires at it with torpedoes, it
   will simulate strikes and damage indications making it appear as
   though your ship is still in the area.

   Depending on the class shuttle used as a decoy, the shuttle will slowly
   or quickly fall apart, showing the attacking ship that you have made a
   run for it and are now sitting somewhere trying to hide.

PHASER . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.05.06

   --- Version 1.50 Notes:

   You can now tell how much power to use (up to this value) when your
   ship fires phasers. This value must be from 1000 up to the amount your
   ship has at the time you implement the command directive.

   If, during battle, your power drops below this value, the command
   file directive will revert to using half of your available power.

DEFAULT fight  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.05.07

   --- Version 1.50 Notes:

   Suppose an enemy ship walks up to your ship and fires a shot or two.
   Sure, your ship fires some shots of its own, testing to see if the
   enemy ship wants a protracted engagement.

   Let's say that the enemy ship finds you distasteful; too much power,
   couldn't possible win. The enemy warps away, quickly least your ship
   notices.

   Don't that make you angry? Like to kick his ass some?

   The "DEFAULT FIGHT" command file directive has been added that will
   be appended to your ships automation commands in that if an enemy
   ship fires at you, your 'ATTACK' directive will apply to it as well
   as any existing ATTACK directives.

   If some ship comes up to yours and fires a shot. If it leaves the
   area, your ship will follow. Of course your BAIL-OUT directives will
   remain in full force so you can limit the engagement as you desire.
   If the enemy ship wants out of the fight, it will either need to
   keep one step ahead of you, or sign out and call back at another
   time.

   Kevin Higgins (1:128/74.0) thought this one up. Thanks.

Command file summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.07.06.00

   --- Version 1.30 Note: (Additional documentation only, not new feature).

   Assist:
      Fire on the same ship the active ship is killing.

   Defend:
      If the currently active ship fires on _anyone_ defend the ship the
      currently active ship is killing by torpedoing the active ship.

   Attack:
      Warp to the area the active ship is and fire on it.

   Run-From:
      Power:
         When power falls below this value.

      Torpedo:
         When the ship has less than this number of torpedoes left.

      Time remaining:
         When the active player has less than this number of minutes.

      Damage:
         When your ship received damage in a fight.

      Decoy:
         Leave a decoy with offer shuttle class.

   Phaser:
      Tells your command file the amount of phaser power to use.

   Default:
      Instructs the automation to continue the attack engagement.

DESTRUCT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.08.00.00

   Well, if you are attacked, boarded, and left to drift, you may have
   no choice but to self destruct. You _could_ ask a friend to come and
   destroy you, but that would not be dignified.

   When you self destruct, you do have a possibility of taking out a few
   of them with you. If there are ships in the area when you self destruct,
   they may be damaged or even destroyed, depending on the shield values.

   If your ship is sitting on another, the proximity will cause the
   destruction of that ship regardless of its shielding.

   There are some other interesting side effects of self destruct that I
   will leave up to the casual player to discover.

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   If you destroy yourself, or are destroyed by an automated ship, for
   that matter, (or are stupid enough to wander into several stars), any
   slaver death weapon parts you may have found or captured are strewn
   throughout space.

FIND . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.09.00.00

   The FIND command will locate any planets that may be within sensor
   range. The location and warp directions are offered.

   In addition, the closest planets warp directions are passed to the
   "GO" command, (See the GO command for additional information).

FIRE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.10.00.00

   The FIRE command lets you fire phasers. You offer the FIRE and then the
   number of energy units to fire all on one line without hitting enter
   between the FIRE and the value:

   fire 20000

   will fire 20000 units of energy.

   The power is distributed among any ships and/or bases in the area and
   there is some degradation to the power through distance.

   Something that a lot of people don't like:

   If you use phasers on a ship that is significantly weaker than yours,
   the Galactic Police will come in and sit off your ships side. This is
   so that if you continue to use phasers on a weak ship, the cops will
   start to fire at you.

   This was done so that weak ships just starting out would have a
   chance. There is no reason why you can't use torpedoes to send the new
   ships to hell.

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   When you fire on an automated ship, either automated through command
   files or by just "being" their, they now fire back. Mayhem didn't
   used to have ships fight back when you hit them with phasers. I don't
   know why I didn't code it, it's just common sense that people would
   elect to fight back regardless of what people are hitting them with.

GO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.11.00.00

   Go is used with the FIND command; you can't GO before you FIND.

   The GO command will feed the location of the closest planet located with
   the FIND command to the warp drives and cause your ship to warp to that
   planet and dock.

   It's interesting to note that if your warp drive isn't capable of
   attaining the voyage in two jumps, the computer will cut the jumps into
   manageable parts. Good navigation is worth billions in defense
   spending...

HELP . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.12.00.00

   The HELP command will give you a one-screen list of the possible
   commands. In addition and perhaps more importantly, it also tells you
   the "extended help" numbers, (see the HLP command).

HLP  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.12.01.00

   You may acquire on-line help for all of the Universal Mayhem commands
   by obtaining an extended help number from the HELP screen. Next to
   each of the commands is a number for the HLP command.

   If you want help, simply enter HLPnn where nn is the extended help
   item number and you will be given any amount of help that exists in the
   on-line help file.

   It's interesting to note that I have made the help file SHIP.HLP
   available for being edited by the system operators such that they may
   elect to add to the help, (and correct my spelling).

INFO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.13.00.00

   Tells you the cost of the various items available for buying and
   selling on a planet. Before you may ask for INFO, however, you
   must dock with the planet.

   In addition to the cost of things, INFO also tells you the technology
   level of the planet.

LEAVE  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.14.00.00

   After being in space for awhile, the crew needs leave. If they don't
   get it, they will start to mess up.

   When you dock with a planet, you may request leave, bringing morale
   back to 100%, (morale drops the longer you remain in space).

   As with most interstellar ports, there are certain social problems of
   a viral nature which may crop up among the crew. To put it nicely, they
   may pick up something they can't get rid of.

   In addition to the clapp, some captains may seed planets with plague
   which will infect your crew after some unknown incubation period.
   You can usually land at a somewhat safe planet by seeing if it has been
   visited before. If not, you will probably avoid the plague if you
   decide to issue shore leave.

   There are some other interesting things about LEAVE that I don't like
   to talk about. You may run into them after awhile.

LONG . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.15.00.00

   The LONG command will cast a long range scan for a specified ship.

   The direction, though not the distance, of the enemy ship is offered
   and experience has shown that it's not all the accurate.

   The LONG will return a direction until you get within sensor scan
   range of the enemy ship which will detect you and turn its
   transponder off, (contrary to Galactic Police requirements for safe
   interspacial transportation standards).

   When the transponder is turned off, you know you are close but you
   will need to search. I will leave it up to you to determine what the
   best method is for finding enemy ships using LONG.

MSG  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.16.00.00

   You may send messages and receive messages from the enemy ships and your
   alliance ships through the subspace mail command.

   After some comments made by Mike Phillips, (231/80), it was determined
   that subspace mail should be enabled or disabled by the System Operator.
   This is because some BBS systems may not support Fido/Opus type mail
   file formats. As Universal Mayhem resumes its development, perhaps these
   formats will be added but for now, if mail is not allowed, you will get
   a message saying you can't send mail.

Reading your subspace mail . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.16.01.00

   When you request STAT, you will be told what mail you have waiting.
   In order to read your mail, however, you must return to the BBS software
   to the echo mail area described something like "Universal Mayhem
   Subspace Mail".

   If mail is not allowed, you will not see any message informing you of
   mail pending.

Sending subspace mail  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.16.02.00

   When you enter MSG, you will be asked for the ship to send mail to.
   You may enter the four-letter ship name or "ALL" to send a general
   subspace message to all players.

   A SUBJECT is entered and then the text of your message.

   MESSAGE ENTRY will NOT wrap around.

   After the message is entered, you are asked if you want to (S)ave the
   message, (C)ontinue entering the message, or (A)bort the message
   entry.

   If subspace mail has been turned off, the MSG command will not work.
   If this is the case, then you will need to use the BBS system that
   calls Universal Mayhem in order to send messages back and forth 
   between players.

   --- Version 1.50 Note:

   If you are running Universal Mayhem and are not on the modem, (that is
   to say, you are running the game remotely), then there is an additional
   command other than Save, Continue, and Abort. This command is the
   Read-In command.

   You won't see the read-in prompt but if you select 'R' as the command
   to perform, then you will be asked for the name of a file to read. The
   contents of the file will be read into the subspace message and then
   you are asked if you wish to Save, Continue, or Abort. Of course, you
   can then request 'R'ead-in again to read in another file.

   This command is intended to be used by SysOps only. Indeed, players
   who dial up; if they request 'R', they will not be given the ability
   to read-in a file.

NAME . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.17.00.00

   When you dock at a planet that has not been named, you may name it.

   There is, however, the possibility that the System Operator configured
   Universal Mayhem without planet names. The loss of this feature, which
   didn't do much anyway, saves some 16 bytes of hard disk space for
   every planet. With 40,000 planets, (as was in the default configuration
   size of the universe), that's 640,000 bytes; half a meg.

   It seems that BB Systems are _always_ looking for more disk space so
   this feature may have been disabled. If this is the case, the NAME
   command will inform you that the planet may not be named.

NAMES  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.18.00.00

   Want to see who owns what ship? This command will do it. It will also
   tell you what ships have been impounded and are available for auction
   and it will also tell you who has bid on what ships.

   If you have bid on a ship and someone else has, you may have to destroy
   that persons ship to invalidate the opposing bids. Anything for money!

   If the naming of planets is allowed by the SysOp, you will also see
   how many planets have been named by everyone. 'Doesn't mean anything,
   but kind of tells you who explores.

   (Actually, there comes to mind a good use for knowing how many planets
   have been at least visited by enemy ships).

   --- Version 1.50 Notes:

   The NAMES command will display 'remote player' next to the name of a
   ship if the player has been imported into the local system using the
   'statistics feature' that is described within this manual.

NAV  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.19.00.00

   The on-board computer will maintain up to three data banks containing
   information on commerce and technology levels for planets.

   To add a planet to a data bank, you must dock with the planet and then
   request NAV. The computer will ask you if you want to add the
   current planet to a data bank and if so, which one.

   You may dump and data bank or view a data banks contents at any time.

   This is useful for retaining commerce information on planets that you
   really like without having to write their locations and values down.

   If the SysOp ever creates a new universe, (yes, SysOps _ARE_ that
   powerful), the nav data stored in your computer banks will become
   invalid. Simply dump them if you notice that the universe has been
   changed. A good indication of this is that the display of navigation
   bank data on your three planets will all say they are dead.

   It could very well be that someone destroyed all of your planets and
   your nav data is correct. It's more likely, however, that the universe
   has changed and your nav data is outdated.

   One other thing that was added to the program later is the ability to
   have the navigational computer warp you directly from your current
   location to the nav planet you specify.

   The distance is _not_ infinite and as such will only get you from your
   current location to the specified nav planet if it can be made in
   less than 50 jumps or so, regardless of your warp drive capacity.

PASS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.19.01.00

   You can change your sign-in password simply by entering this command.
   You will be asked to enter the old password so there is a small
   measure of security in case you walk away from the terminal and
   someone sneaks up to it!

PEACE  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.20.00.00

   You may make up to five alliances.

   There is no way to break an alliance except by attacking one of them.

   Alliances give you a range of possibilities and hazards and I will leave
   it up to you to determine exactly what they might be and what you
   want to do with the capability.

   I have seen in the BASIC version huge alliances consisting of many
   ships captains making cross alliances and enemies; setting ship against
   ship and remote robots as sentries reporting both enemy and friend
   movements.

   Such wanton violations of alliances I have seen!

Mutual Alliances . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.20.01.00

   There are many good reasons for having mutual alliances. The first thing
   that comes to mind is the ability to board an allied ship and take a
   few things.

   More importantly, however, is that attack sled swarm groups will _not_
   attack a ship that has a mutual alliance if it warps into the area
   where an attack group is stationed.

   To make a mutual alliance, both you and the captain of the other ship
   must declare peace with each other. Subspace mail is a good way to do this.

PING . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.21.00.00

   You can find out how strong a ship is by attacking it... There has GOT
   to be a better way, one that's less damaging, and PING is it.

   PING will cause a radar pulse to be sent out in an omni-directional
   spread pattern from your ship outward through the entire area. The
   strength of the return is determined by the strength of the ships in
   the area.

   Usually experience has shown that if there is 100 million units of
   power in the area excluding your ships power, you will get a return of
   around 100.

   All of the ships in the area add to the strength of the return. The
   shields around ships get their shielding capability by reflecting high
   energy particles. The stronger the shield, the stronger the return
   ping.

PLAGUE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.22.00.00

   When you see pirates in the area and you have a lot of cash, you can
   buy plague and seed planets with it. Anyone who visits that planet will
   become infected, even your own ship if you ever come back.

   Plague will kill a percentage of visiting ships crew after some random
   incubation period. Though fatal to many, there will be some crew
   left to operate the ship in most cases.

   After working its way through the ship, operations will return to normal
   unless there is a relapse.

   Now seeding planets with plague is something Klingons would do. It's
   not considered nice to seed a planet with plague and other ships may
   group together for temporary alliances to destroy you!

   There is a one-in-ten chance of a planet getting rid of the plague. The
   chances only take place when a ship visits the planet so if one of your
   favorite planets seems to be infected, simply visit it often and
   eventually the plague will be removed.

   Of course the cost in crew members is quite high...

POWER  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.23.00.00

   Redistribute power between shields and engines.

PROTECT  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.24.00.00

   You may protect a planet against being destroyed by torpedoes. This will
   cost a lot of money but is useful when you find a couple of really
   close commerce planets and want to keep them.

   If anyone fires at a protected planet, the torp simply bounces off and
   heads for deep space where presumably it will find its way through
   another stellar system and onto some innocent planet that's never even
   heard of the battles taking place billions of light years away.

   I have noticed that if the SysOp creates a new universe over the old
   one, the planets you may have protected are lost forever. If you spend
   a lot of money, then, you will have lost it all.

   --- Version 1.00 Note:

   The standings have been re-thought since the older version. Now, the
   player with the most planets owned are listed as the number one
   players. 

   See 'TAXES' to see how being a property owner assists you in your
   financial status.

   There is an interesting side effect to owning planets. You may own
   one hundred of them but I noticed that you can find a way to own
   up to 400 of them. This is a bug that I know about but elected to
   keep in and in fact, re-coded to allow its continued existence.

   Listen up:

   Let's say that you have protected 100 planets. This is the limit that
   was originally coded into the Mayhem project. Let's suppose that one
   of those planets is at 1211-8769. If you try to buy another planet
   you are told that you can't.

   The way you can buy an additional three hundred planets is to take
   the X-Coordinate 1211 and search from the Y-Coordinate 8769 to the
   left until you find another planet. You will be allowed to protect
   that one and all others you can find. The same goes for those planets
   that are on the same X-Coordinate along the right hand side of the
   Y-Coordinate.

   The reason was simple: The locations of four planets are known for
   each X-Coordinate. When you are at location 1211-8769, Mayhem will
   read record number 1211 from the UNIVERSE.DAT file and search 
   through the four Y-Coordinate positions for planets. If any of them
   are found to be 8769, Mayhem knows you are docked at a planet.

   When protecting a planet, the players data file retains only the
   X-Coordinate location of the planet. It then reads the PLANETS.DAT
   file for the planets data structures of which their are four of them
   and sees if the planet is protected. You can protect all four in
   the same UNIVERSE.DAT record and have MAYHEM plug all four data
   records in PLANETS.DAT.

   --- Version 1.00 Note:

   When you destroy a ship, you gain ownership of all of its planets.
   You are not informed of where those planets are, however. If you
   do find one, or want to un-protect one you have protected, you need
   only dock with it and type 'PROTECT'. Because it's protected by
   you, you can un-protect it for some 10 percent of it's original
   value.

QUIT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.25.00.00

   When you have to get back to work, the QUIT, and in fact, the EXIT
   command, will engage the command file automation computers, (if you have
   left one designed), to fight for you, and you are transported off
   ship to some unknown reality, (at least so far as Universal Mayhem is
   concerned).

   You will usually be returned to the BBS software that shelled out to
   Universal Mayhem, where you may continue to FidoNet!

   SysOps may configure their system to do other things with you,
   however, as I supply them with an ERRORLEVEL that they may use to
   tighten their systems operations. A listing of the ERRORLEVELS that
   I offer and a description is offered.

REM  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.26.00.00

   You may buy and maintain up to four remote robot sensors. These are
   quite useful bits of technology that you can do a lot with.

Scanning from Remote . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.26.01.00

   If you have a remote deployed at some location, say remote number 2,
   you may request a sensor scan from it:

   rem2 [return]

   will perform a sensor scan as though you were at that location. Your
   remote will show up in the center of the sensor screen rather than your
   ship.

   This is useful for keeping on eye on your base to see if there are
   any ships in the area while you are on the other side of the universe.

Deploying a Remote . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.26.02.00

   To deploy a remote, such as remote 3, at the current location:

   rem3p

   If you warp off a few sectors and perform a sensor scan, you will see
   <RR> off a little where you were before you warp off a little.

Recalling a Remote . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.26.03.00

   You may pick up a remote by warping onto it and performing something
   like this, (This example will pick up remote 0):

   rem0r

   This will cause the recall of remote 0. When you back off a few sectors
   and perform a sensor scan, you will see that the remote is now on board
   and ready to be deployed somewhere else or sold.

RPT  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.27.00.00

   The RPT command is the LAST thing on a command string. It will cause
   the re-execution of a string of commands. Something like this

   b1100;w44;s1100;s1100;w64;rpt30

   This command string will see 100 units of cargo, warp direction 4 for
   four sectors, sell 100 units of cargo, warp direction 6 four sectors,
   and do it all again 30 times.

   The highest number of RPT iterations is 30, the smallest is 1.

   If you need to terminate a repeat, hit ESCape on the keyboard.

S (Sell) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.28.00.00

   This command allows you to sell things. See "B" for buy to see how
   things are sold.

SCAN . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.00.00

   The scan command will allow you to take a look at the surrounding area.
   The result of the scan is a half-screen of ascii-graphic type data. The
   various elements of the scan that you may see are:

   SHIP - Any upper case four-letter word is a ship. Yours is always center
   ship - Any lower case four-letter word is a base.
   <RR> - Remote robot sensor
   @@@@ - Ion field
   #### - Edge of the universe
   <00> - A planet
   <**> - A star
   <%%> - A triten mine
   <  > - A black hole. May have a white hole somewhere
    .   - An attack swarm
   <GP> - The Galactic Police attack ship
   O--- - A comet in clockwise orbit about a star
   ---O - A comet in counterclockwise orbit about a star
   <OX> - A pirate ship
   #nn# - A goal item, (the nn represents a number from 00 to 09)
   <-n- - A scout ship (number n) is inbound
   -n-> - A scout ship (number n) is outbound
   <>-n - A scout ship (number n) is on station
 
   If you scan a comet and are the first to do so, you are allowed to name
   the comet anything you wish. The names of the comets are available, as
   well as a list of those that have been found, through the 'COMETS' command.

   Because enemy ships can become cloaked, your sensor array technology must
   be higher or equal to the cloaked ship before the cloaked ship will
   appear on the sensor scan. If the sensor scan can not see an enemy ship
   but one is in the area, "Sensors report an ion trail in this area..." is
   offered to let you know its around.

   The borders of the sensor scan show the positions of the various objects.
   Your ship is always center-screen unless you are pulling a scan from one
   of your remote robot sensors in which case <RR> will appear in the center
   of the sensor scan.

Ships  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.01.00

   You may attack, board, and destroy ships. Every time you do so, you
   will be credited with the kill and reported in the standings.

Bases  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.02.00

   You may attack, board, and destroy bases. The crew on board the
   enemy base will fight back to the crewman unless you have a mutual
   alliance with the captain of the base.

   To destroy the base, you must lower its shields and fire at least
   an additional 10 torpedoes at it. You may leave it damaged if you want
   in which case the captain must pay to have it repaired.

Remote robot sensors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.03.00

   Remote robot sensors may be destroyed. You should never attempt to
   land on one that isn't yours as it might attach itself to you.

Attack sled swarms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.04.00

   Attack sleds are dangerous. You should try to avoid them unless they
   belong to you.

   Usually left behind to defend a base or star system, they will attack
   you move for move with great strength.

   As you fire into their formation, you may or may not damage them.

Stars, planets, mines, black holes . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.05.00

   Don't fire or land on a star or mine as they will cause damage.

   You may fire at or warp through a black hole. Some of the holes have
   corresponding white holes which will come out at a specific place in
   the universe next to another black hole. If so, simply entering the
   black hole you came out of will return you to the original area of
   space.

Galactic Police  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.06.00

   Never fire at a cop.

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   When you pay taxes, the cops take the money and buy things. Normally,
   they start buying power, hull patches, torpedoes, and the like. When
   they have all they need, they start hoarding the cash.

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   The cops will move around at times.

   --- Version 1.50 Notes:

   If you destroy a cop, then its command file will be activated with
   orders to kill you. If you kill _that_ cop, another will replace it.

   You will, in fact, be hounded for quite a long time. It wont even
   end when you are destroyed as if you create another ship with the
   same name, it too will be hounded.

   It will only end when someone else destroys the cops.

Ion storms   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.07.00

   You can attempt to hide in an ion storm. Human captains may or may
   not be able to find your ship if you are in the ion field.

   The ion fields center is a hypergravitational source which signularity
   never changes; the center is always the center and never moves. The
   field around the center, however, will move, grow, and shrink.

Comets   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.08.00

   There are comets in the universe. Why not?

   If you run into one, (stupid thing to do, really; watch where you're
   going, why don't you!?), you get destroyed.

   If you scan a comet that hasn't been scanned before, you are given
   the ability to name the comet. When the COMETS command is entered,
   the locations of and the names of the comets are given.

   One additional thing that COMETS tells you is the central location of
   the ion storm. Every universe has one.

Pirates  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.09.00

   You can buy plague from pirates if you have the cash.

   Pirates usually warp in and out of your area quickly so if you want to
   do business with them, you must do so quickly.

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   Pirates fight back...

   They have waited around for awhile... They know you have money... Why
   don't you buy from them? After awhile, they get a little tired of this
   treatment and attack you. Sorry, tough universe.

   --- Version 1.41 Notes:

   It works now, the pirates will really fight back. You have a good chance
   of killing them with the first shot as they typically wish to trade with
   you and are expecting peace! If you kill them, you gain a cool reward.

   If you fail to kill them, however, they can destroy your ship! Be
   careful when you say war to a pirate!

   --- Version 1.41 Notes:

   There are good pirates, and then there are bad pirates. Bad pirates will
   "slash and run" your ship on occasion. Most bad pirates are chicken at
   heart and will warp in, fire on you, and head out at high warp.

   Though you can't do anything about the bad pirates, you could always find
   some good pirates and kill them for their brothers! That'll teach 'em!

   If you have a plague class 10 or better, then rouge pirate will not
   fire on your ship.

   --- Version 1.50 Notes:

   It's harder to destroy a pirate ship and phasers will work now. If you
   are able to destroy one, you get credit for the kill.

Goal Items . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.29.10.00

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   A MAJOR update to Universal Mayhem is the addition of what I call
   "Goal Items". It's actually quite interesting...

   Strewn through out the universe, there are ten parts to the ultimate
   weapon. The "Slaver Death Weapon" was broken up and distributed
   through out time and space many millions of years ago and the people
   of the universe back then vowed never to let it be reassembled.

   Of course, your goal is to do just that... The parts you need to
   find are:

      dual frequency bipolar power pack
      semitransparent liquid teramodulator
      spherical wave guide director
      magnetic field grip
      fully integrated infrared site
      monodirectional bounce/return auditator
      status/display information screen
      back-blast heat shield
      self deploying and locking mounting grid
      auto breach extending muzzle distender

   Other ships will have some items, perhaps; the rest are floating in
   space. There is an additional command "BOUNTY" that displays the ships
   which have the parts listed above.

   Once you have all of the parts, you have an additional command 
   available to you called "TRIGGER" which will trigger the device.

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:

   In the multi-universe version of Mayhem, (Version 1.4 and greater),
   the slaver death weapon parts are distributed throughout UNIVERSE
   0, (which is the default universe). This limiting of the scope
   of the search was performed because the search times would start
   to exceed the useful life-time of the Sun.

   By moving the Earth back a few A.U. we might have enough time during
   the red giant stage but I hardly think this program will be used
   in many systems at that time.

SLED . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.30.00.00

   Attack sleds are small one-crewman attack ships that are placed into
   groups or swarms. You may maintain up to five swarms, with any number
   of sled ships in them.

   Usually left behind near your base to help protect it, they can also be
   left near comfortable commerce planets.

   If you warp into an area of space which has enemy sleds, you will be
   attacked by them. You can fight back, of course.

   You may deploy or recall attack sleds by warping onto the swarm center
   or the area of space you want the swarm and selecting command SLED.

   Attack swarms must be refueled from time to time. To do so, you can
   either recall and re-deploy the sleds, or you can simply warp on top of
   a swarm and deploy one more sled. This sled will refuel every sled in the
   swarm.

   If your attack sleds run out of fuel, they will drop into space and
   turn very cold. So cold, in fact, the crewmen will be deep frozen and
   you'll never be able to find them.

   ---> These sleds will attack anyone who warps into their station space
   unless your ship has a mutual alliance with the ship warping in.

   If you have declared peace with a ship and that ship has declared
   peace with you, your attack sleds will _not_ attack that ship.

   One thing I noticed during the extensive Alpha testing phase: When you
   have an alliance with a ship and fire at its swarms, the alliance is
   not broken if the swarm is destroyed. Dead men tell no tails.

SPY  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.31.00.00

   You may move your remote robot sensors remotely, even if you are on the
   other side of the universe. The command takes the remote robot number to
   move, the direction, and the distance. The possible directions are:

                                    2
                                1       3
                              4     5     6
                                7       9
                                    8

                 The possible velocities are from 1 to 5.

   If you move a remote on top of an enemy ship, that remote becomes attached
   to the enemy ship and is not removable by it. Being so attached will
   enable you to know that enemy ships location at all times and you can
   pull a sensor scan from it, (see REM command).

   It's interesting to note that an enemy ship can not see your remote so if
   it's controlled from a COMMAND file to RUN-FROM your ship, you can use the
   SPY command to position a remote robot sensor on top of it.

STAND  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.32.00.00

   If you want to see everyone's' standings, this command will tell you the
   top ten strongest ships, (you need at least one million units of power
   to make the list), and the top ten killers.

STAT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.33.00.00

   This command will give you the status of the ship, any base, and
   various other things about you and your ship.

   Most importantly, this command will also scan the Subspace Message
   areas for any mail waiting for you. It will report the total number of
   message files either read or new that is for your ship.

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   The status display also shows what parts to the slaver death weapon
   you may have on board.

T (Torpedoes) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.34.00.00

   The torp command is how you fire at objects in space. You offer the
   direction and the distance the torp is allowed to travel. The directions:

                              1   2   3
                            4     5     6
                              7   8   9

   You may fire at anything and anyone you wish but be sure you know that
   people may shoot back. If you hit a mine or a star, they will blow off
   a lot of high energy gamma radiation in your general direction and cause
   some damage.

   As the torpedo moves through space, its positional tracking radio sends
   back information on its position to your ship. It will continue to do
   so until the distance runs out or until it hits something.

   If you fire a torpedo into an attack swarm and cause some damage, you
   will get damage reports. The same goes for hitting un-shielded bases.

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   If you fire at a goal item, (parts of the slaver death weapon), the
   torpedo with simply sail right through it. You don't think you can
   destroy something that has lasted many billions of years, do you?

TAXES  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.35.00.00
 
   Every time you buy something, your ships computer will add the taxes
   required to the total. When the taxes reach some 10,000 credits, your
   taxes are due. When you enter TAXES, the command will allow you to
   pay the taxes due.

   Note that you may pay taxes even if they are not due. If you have some
   118 credits in taxes, you may pay them.

   It's interesting to note that you don't have to pay your taxes. But
   remember that if you don't, you will be warned twice that they are due.
   After the second time, the Galactic Police will follow you around to
   keep an eye on you.

   After an additional two warnings, your ship will be impounded and put
   up for auction.


   --- Version 1.00 Note:

   In version 1.00 of Universal Mayhem, taxes have been re-thought to
   allow taxes to be paid to the owners of the planets. If you sell some
   things on a planet that is owned by no one, then the taxes go to
   the Galactic Police and you pay the full tax amount.

   If you own the planet you sell at, then you pay just 10 percent of
   the tax amount to the Galactic Police.

   If you sell at a planet owned by another player, you pay the full
   tax amount but the players ship gets the credits.

   ACtually, all taxes that are due are stored in your ships computers
   and you have no access to them. When it comes time to pay your taxes,
   you request 'TAXES' and are informed of the maximum of ten planets
   that you have taxes on and the amount you owe the cops.

   IF YOU HAVE TAXES OUTSTANDING AT TEN PLANETS ALREADY and try to sell
   at planet number eleven, you will not be allowed to do so until you
   pay of the taxes owed at one of the ten planets.

   If you own a planet that someone sells things at, your ships credits
   will increase when they pay taxes.

TIME . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.36.00.00

   This command lets you know the number of minutes left to play as well
   as the number of times you have signed in.

W (Warp drive) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.37.00.00

   The warp command is how you get around in the universe. It provides a
   method to move in any permissible direction in jumps that your warp drive
   class will allow. The directions are:


                                  1   2   3
                                    \ | /
                                4 --  5  -- 6
                                    / | \
                                  7   8   9


   For the sample warp in the syntax above, this would warp the ship
   towards direction 4, (left), five spaces.

   If you warp onto a star or a mine, you will receive some damage. The ship
   will then be blown off of the star or mine one sector.

   If you warp onto a black hole, you will enter it and come out at another
   point in the universe. Some black holes have linked white holes. This
   can bee seen when you enter a hole and come out of the hole sitting
   right next to another hole. Enter that hole and if you come out sitting
   next to the first black hole, they are linked.

   See command 'RPT' to see how warp commands are easily strung together.

COLOR  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.40.00.00

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   COLOR has been added! Finally! The SysOp must allow the use of colors
   through the configuration file SHIP.CFG and you must also inform Mayhem
   if you want colors when your ship is created.

   The COLOR command will toggle colors on and off for your ship. If
   the SysOp hasn't allowed colors, then you are told that colors aren't
   available.

   The colors that Mayhem use have been tested in many ways.

   o When running Mayhem from the terminal, ANSI.SYS must be loaded.

   o When running Mayhem from a dial-up modem, you should be running
     a terminal program that has ANSI emulation. The program that has
     been tested to destruction was PROCOMM and PROCOMM PLUS TEST DRIVE.

   The Mayhem program sends everything in high intensity colors to
   make them bright. I only have it send an escape sequence if the
   color needs to change. This saves time when sending a screen full of
   information in that not every screen element is preceded with a
   color sequence. The drawback is that if you perform a screen clear
   from your terminal emulator, the first part of the display that
   Mayhem sends next is not going to be the color that I wanted
   it to be. After a color change, however, Mayhem will fix it up
   again.

   QMODEM, Mirror, BitCom, PC Talk 31... These I haven't even bothered
   to test against Mayhem. Why should I? Though I don't support the
   Forbin project, (Yes, I'm one of those...), I can advertise for them
   can't I?

BOUNTY . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.50.00.00

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   When you destroy a planet, the Galactic Police put a price on your
   head. When you request STAT, you can see what you're worth.

   This command lets all the other players see what they are worth and
   let's you know if anyone is worth trying to take down.

   BOUNTY also has another display that you might find interesting.
   Read about "Goal Items". This command will display the names of the
   ships that have any of these highly fought over items. 

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:

   If you have a bounty on your ship, the universe your ship is in will
   be displayed for all players to see!

MAP  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.51.00.00

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:   New command

   The map command will offer you a view of the multi-universe layout and
   show you which universe you have movable items in. It will also show
   you what universe leads to where and what corner of the current universe
   to go to to find a gateway into the next universe.

SCOUT  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.52.00.00

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:   New command

   You may send scout ships out into the universes and have them report
   on what they find.  You may send them into a specified direction,
   towards a goal, and set it to report what it finds.

   The commands are:

   o r - Recall. This will pick up the scout ship. You must warp onto
     the scout ship and then perform this command. When recalled, you
     will receive a status report on what the scout saw.

   o p - Place. This will drop the scout ship at your current location
     and send it on its way.

   o d - Destruct. This command will cause the powerful scout ship to
     self destruct. Once a scout ship is destroyed, however, it can
     never be replaced, even by boarding an enemy ship. The reason you
     would want to destruct a scout ship is that you may have it sneak
     up on an enemy ship and latch onto it with the scout ships
     magnetic grapples before blowing its engines. It causes all kinds
     of problems on the enemy ship.

   o s - Status. This command will cause the scout ship offered to
     give a status report. The information acquired is quite useful
     but by asking it to report over radio, the scout ships location
     is easily found.

   o c - Clear. This command will cause the accumulated data a scout ship
     has acquire to be cleared. It is normally done when you recall your
     scout or when it gets to station and reports. It's not cleared
     automatically so that you can request a report any time after you
     recall your scout.

   o f - Full. This command will offer a full report on all scout ships.
     You are offer the scout ships location and universe, where it will
     be going to (or coming from), if it's on its inbound, outbound, on
     station, or stalled, and if it will stay on station or return once
     its destination is realized. The scout ship that is marked with a
     "*" on the left indicates that that scout ship is the next one to make
     a move.

   When a scout ship is scanned, you will see one of the following:

      <-n- - A scout ship (number n) is inbound
      -n-> - A scout ship (number n) is outbound
      <>-n - A scout ship (number n) is on station

Scout technical aspects  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.52.01.00

   (Excerpt from design document)

   Version 1.40 has many new aspects to it over the older version 1.30. The
   use of scout ships increases the possibilities many fold. Use your scout
   ships wisely as once they are gone, they are gone for good.

   Speed:

   When Universal Mayhem is loaded, it pulls into RAM various aspects of
   the players data records (about the ships they run) out of the disk file
   so that the game is able to make fast computations on automation of
   warps without having to constantly update the disk file.

   The scout ships does much the same thing. Once your ship is signed in,
   Universal Mayhem will pull your scout ships locations and directives
   out of the disk file and stuff the data into RAM.

   In RAM, the ships will be moved symbolically to the desired destination,
   whether it be a location somewhere distant, or back to your ship for
   eventual recall.

   Information:

   The scout ships are moved one at a time, every 1 second or so of
   accumulated keyboard wait time. They are, in fact, automated to warp slowly
   to the destination you directed it to, collecting information along the way,
   and then either holding on station for you to pick it up or call it in,
   or returning automatically.

   The information they acquire automatically is:

      o The location and technology level of planets they come close to

      o The location and "ping" level of ships and bases they come close to

      o The location of remote robot sensors they come close to

      o The location and strengths of attack sled swarms they come close to

   This information is stored in the scout ships until you tell it to
   clear its information. Usually, once the scout ship is recalled (brought
   on board), you ask it to report, capturing the information on your side
   of the phone line to a file for later viewing.

   The scout ships maintain the information by creating, updating, and then
   erasing data files on the computer. The name of the data file depends on
   the name of your ship as it is the first four letters and the .SCT
   extension.

   These files are ASCII files consisting of one-line information phrases.
   The first two characters of the file contains the scout ship number that
   the entry exists for.

   When, for instance, scout ship 3 is requested to report to ship DUCK, the
   file DUCK.SCT is opened, and all entries starting with the "03" characters
   is displayed. When, for instance, scout ship 3 is cleared upon request,
   all entries starting with "03" are changed to start with "42", thus
   marking them for eventual compaction or overwriting.

   When a ship gets destroyed, its scout files are removed.

   Automation:

   Universal Mayhem keeps track of the last scout ship moved. It will walk
   through the scout ships until all have been processed, and then start it
   all over again. There is a time delay between each action, however, to
   allow the ships to get their at a warp factor around 4.

   There is a function in Universal Mayhem that is passed the X and Y
   coordinates of the players SHIP, and the X and Y coordinates of the
   scouts destination. This is true if a scout ship is on its outbound
   leg of its journey.

   When the scout ships on its inbound leg, the function is passed the X and
   Y coordinate of the scout ship and then the X and Y coordinate of the
   scout ships mother ship.

   The function returns the direction angle of where to warp towards to
   move an object from point to point. If the function returns "center",
   then the two objects have met. There is a skew factor also passed to
   the function to allow the "center" to be any number of sectors in size,
   allowing an incoming object to come within sensor range of another and
   then stopping just off to the side of the target, rather than ending
   right on top of it.

   Once an object is centered in an area of its destination, the function
   contains to return "center" and the scout does not move again. If the
   mother ship moves without recalling its scout, the function will again
   start returning angles to the mother ship and the scout will follow.

   Scanning:

   The scout ships, by virtue of having warp factors of 4, will jump into
   warp, pop out, jump back into warp, pop out, and then perform a scan of
   the area. It will continue to do so, collecting information every time
   it pops out of warp the second time.

   The reason it doesn't collect information every time is because of the
   low warp value and low scanning field. It takes two warps to get past
   the last viewed boundary.

   Disk Update:

   Only when all 10 scout ships have been automated to some extent will the
   players data record get updated with the new locations of the scouts. In
   this way, re refrain from updating the disk file every 15 seconds for
   each scout ship.

   In the event of a system crash or re-boot, the last move of each scout
   ship could become lost, but it is highly doubtful. In any event, the
   last few moves of a scout ship (or all of them) shouldn't be cause for
   concern.

LEASH  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.53.00.00

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:   New command

   You may attach a leash to an enemy ship and do with it as you will,
   providing you and your ship has the ability to do so. The possible
   commands that are allowed  as secondary aspects of the leash are:

   o tight      - Your ship is tractored to the enemy ship for the
                  rest of the day. If your enemy ships captain gets
                  into the system, your ship will continue to be
                  leashed to his ship for his play period. The leash
                  is broken when your ship or the enemy ship bails
                  out of a fight according to its command file
                  directives. This means that you and the enemy ship
                  may fight each other.

   o shove      - Your ship may shove the enemy ship in any direction
                  you choose. Its warp engines won't be able to stop
                  your tractors unless emergency power is applied as
                  a bail-out according to the enemy ships or your
                  ships command file directives. You and the enemy ship
                  may fire at each other in this configuration.

   o drag       - Your ship may drag the enemy ship for a certain
                  amount of distance until the enemy ships engines
                  warp up to enough power to pull away from you. You
                  may not fire at the enemy ship in this configuration
                  but it may fire on you. You may not pull an enemy
                  ship through a gateway.

   If you simply enter "leash", you will be offered a report on the
   current state of any leash you may have on another ship or if there
   is one on your ship.

OWN  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.54.00.00

   --- Version 2.3 Notes:

   This command will show the player the location of the planets that are
   owned. It's good for finding the location of the planets that a ship had
   when it was destroyed and haned over to the winner!

   When you go to a planet that is protected, you can say PROTECT again and
   unprotect the planet to get most of the original price of the planet
   converted into quick cash!

# - Keyboard Macros  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.01.55.00.00

   --- Version 2.3 Notes:

   Syntax:

   # [enter]
   # [0 through 5] [enter]
   # [0 through 5] [command string to save]

   To view your Keyboard Macros, hit # and then enter.

   To execute a Keyboard Macro, enter # followed by the number of the stored
   Keyboard Macro you wish to execute.

   To store and then execute a Keyboard Macro, enter # followed by a number
   from 0 through 5 and then follow it with the command string..

   Examples:


                #0w910;w910;w910;find;go;protect;rpt30

   This will save the following Keyboard Macro to Macro number 0:

                w910;w910;w910;find;go;protect;rpt30

   After you enter the Keyboard Macro, it will be executed. To execute the
   Keyboard Macro again, you would type:

                #0

   To view your Keyboard Macros, you would type:

                #

   And you would see something like this:

        #0 'w910;w910;w910;find;go;protect;rpt30'
        #1 ''
        #2 ''
        #3 ''
        #4 ''
        #5 ''

   The '' indicates the Macro Command String is empty.

Command Files  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.00.00.00

   Command files allow you to automate your ship while you are not signed
   in. It tells Universal Mayhem how to handle enemy ships and friendly
   ships.

   Note that for any of these you may say ALL for the ship names.

ATTACK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.01.00.00

   You may attack any number of ships you want. If you make a list of
   ships to attack, when they sign in, your ship will warp into the area
   they are in and take them on.

ASSIST . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.02.00.00

   The assist command will allow you to help friends when they attack
   other ships. If you assist, say DUCK, when DUCK attacks someone, your
   ship will warp into the battle zone and start attacking the same ship
   DUCK is attacking.

   It's important to note that if the friendly ship warps around the battle
   zone or leaves the area, your ship will stop assisting unless the
   friendly ship starts attacking again.

DEFEND . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.03.00.00

   Doesn't work. It was intended to defend ships in the event anyone
   attacked them. The only problem at this stage is the amount of memory
   required to store all ships defense information. 

   Some day, perhaps... This may be added.

RUN-FROM . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.03.00.00

   You can tell Universal Mayhem who to run from if they sign in. As they
   get too close, your ship will attempt to run for it!

BAIL-OUT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.04.00.00

   Of course, your ship will need to know when to stop attacking and make a
   run for it. This is the BAIL-OUT parameters in the command files. You
   have a variety of ways to bail out.

   If your ship bails out, it will randomly choose a direction and then
   randomly choose a number of jumps to warp in that direction. It will
   then turn the command file automation aspects off, leaving your ship in
   a posture to defend only if attacked.

POWER  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.04.01.00

   Bail-out when power drops below a given value.

TORP . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.04.02.00

   Bail out when the number of torpedoes drops below a certain number.

TIME . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.04.03.00

   Bail out of the player has less than this number of minutes left
   to play. This is so that your ship is not left in the area if the
   time runs out.

DAMAGE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.02.04.04.00

   Bail out if your ship receives any damage.

Stringing  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.03.00.00.00

   You may string commands together by using the ; character. As an example,
   the following can be done:

   find;go;s7100;find;go;b7100

   This is rather wasteful in time and power but is useful for finding
   the closest planet, warping to it, selling a class 100 shuttle, finding
   the next closest planet, going to it, and then buying a class 100
   shuttle.

   Of course, you can loop this:

   find;go;s7100;find;go;b7100;rpt30

   This will cause the execution of the command string 30 times. It's
   important to note that if you ever want to terminate a loop, you only
   need to hit the ESCape key.

Help . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02.04.00.00.00

   Help is available in a variety of ways. The most common is the HELP
   command and the HLP commands.

Description  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 03.00.00.00.00

   Universal Mayhem is a game where FidoNet people may fight against
   each other symbolically. The players build and maintain ships and bases,
   and try to perform commerce such that their ships are strong enough
   to attack and defeat other ships.

   At the heart of the game is the alliance postures which may crop up.
   Ships may form alliances with other ships which offer interesting
   possibilities, the least of which is a common base.

Installation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.00.00.00.00

   Create a subdirectory to hold the Universal Mayhem files. Then extract
   the archive files, (usually UM-C-VER.ARC).

   Edit SHIP.CFG according to what you want. The sample SHIP.CFG file is
   quite descriptive.

Subdirectories . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.01.00.00.00

   Usually, Universal Mayhem is placed into a directory called MAYHEM. This
   is by no means a requirement. The configuration file SHIP.CFG contains
   a path by which Universal Mayhem may find subspace mail, (echo mail).

Configuration file . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.00.00.00

   Notice that the last line MUST have a carriage return after it. Also
   note that you may place any comments after the parameters.

   The parameters MUST be in the order indicated or nothing will work.
   There may NOT be any blank lines in the SHIP.CFG file either. 

XSize of the universe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.01.00.00

   This value is the left-to-right size of the universe. It is also used
   to determine the number of planets, stars, black holes, white holes,
   and mines in the universe.

   It must be from 1000 to 32766 in value.

YSize of the universe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.02.00.00

   This value is the up-to-down size of the universe. It is multiplied with
   the xsize to determine the total number of sectors, (spaces), in the
   universe.

   It must be from 1000 to 32766 in value.

   Typically, the xsize and the ysize are the same.

System operators password  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.03.00.00

   This is the password to use with the SYSOP command. The SYSOP command
   allows you to perform maintenance to the users files. The reason there
   is a password is because suspension to DOS is allowed.

Time to play . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.04.00.00

   This is the number of minutes a player may play on the system before
   being bounced out. This number of minutes are in effect for a day.

   IMPORTANT:
   
   If you have players already in the user file and you extend the number
   of minutes allowed to play in SHIP.CFG, those players will not have the
   extended amount of minutes to play for the day. If they sign in the next
   day, they will have the full number of minutes to play.

Starting allowed time to play  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.05.00.00

   You may turn the game off and on with this value and the one that
   follows.

   This value determines the starting time that the game may be played.
   If it is 00:00, then there is no starting time and anyone may play at
   any time.

Ending allowed time to play  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.06.00.00

   This is the ending time that players are allowed to play. If you wanted
   to allow play from 7 am to 4 p.m., then these two values would look like:

   07:00			;starting time
   16:00			;ending time

Number of players maximum  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.07.00.00

   The number of players who can have a ship at one time. There is a
   limit somewhere around 150 players.

   Usually you leave this at around 100. If you have more players than
   that, the SYSOP command has an option allowing the increase of this
   value without destroying the players files.

Subspace (EchoMail) mail Directory . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.08.00.00

   This is the subdirectory name of where subspace mail goes. You should
   NOT append an additional \ to the end of the file name as I'm not
   sure if I put code in to strip it away.

   In the development system, there is a batch file that takes the mail
   from the development directory and throws it into the dutchie 
   subdirectory. It's name is TOSS.BAT and it looks like this:

                        copy *.msg \dutchie\mgm\mayhem
                        del \dutchie\mgm\mayhem\lastread
                        del *.msg

   Not very sophisticated, true, and your system of tossing mail from
   the Universal Mayhem directory, renumbering it, and so forth, is
   going to need to be done totally different according to your system.

   See also the section for file LASTMSG.SHP here next:

LASTMSG.SHP file . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.08.01.00

   This file contains the highest message number in the destination
   directory for Universal Mayhem to start creating.

   --- Version 1.50 Note:

   Mayhem doesn't use the LASTMSG.SHP file any more. If you have it, get
   rid of it if Mayhem used it. Universal Mayhem will now scan the mail
   directory as described in the SHIP.CFG file and find out what the
   highest message number in that directory is. It will create the next
   highest message number and put the message it creates in that directory.

FidoNetwork Mailing address  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.09.00.00

   This is your systems FidoNet address. If you don't have one, it should
   be set to 0.

Subspace (EchoMail) outbound network address . . . . . . . 04.02.10.00.00

   If you are tied into the FidoNet echo mail for Universal Mayhem, this
   is the address of the system that you feed and poll for AREA:MAYHEM.

   If you don't want to have it, set this address to 0.

   --- Version 1.50 Note:

   The destination address may now contain the name of a file that has within
   it a list of FidoNet addresses where the subspace echo mail should be
   delivered to. The above SHIP.CFG file, using this feature of offering a
   file name, would look something like this:

                        (SHORTENED FROM ABOVE)

   c:\dutchie\mgm\mayhem ;where to find subspace messages
   1:102/901.0           ;Origination Network address for subspace mail
   @mayhem.lst           ;Destination Network address for subspace mail
   0                     ;Com port assignment 0=com1, 1=com2
   on                    ;Allow Subspace Messages ('on' or 'off' only)

                        (SHORTENED FROM ABOVE)

   Here you will notice that the destination network address has been
   changed to a file called MAYHEM.LST. The @ before the name must be
   present or the mail will go no where.

   This file contains network addresses that must be explicitly described
   completely and look something like this:

                1:128/74
                1:365/47
                1:102/901.1

   The zone number, network number, and node number must be supplied. The
   point number is optional. You can _NOT_ use keywords like 'all' and 'mine'
   as you can with FidoNet node crunchers and the like.

Communication Port Assignment  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.10.01.00

   VERY important: If your modem is on port 1, this value should be o.
   If on port 2, this value MUST be 1.

   No other ports are supported. If you have an application where you
   really MUST have Universal Mayhem on another com port, let me know and
   I will spend the time on it and mail the update. Free of charge.

Allow Subspace Mail  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.10.02.00

   VERY IMPORTANT if your BBS software does NOT support Fido/Opus type
   message formats. Unfortunately, only this one format is supported as
   yet. After I get some additional mail file formats, they will be
   added.

   If you don't want Universal Mayhem to allow Subspace Mail, then set
   this value to 'off', otherwise set it to 'on'. The word does not need
   to be in uppercase but it can be. Universal Mayhem will read it and
   check it for yes/no either way.

Watch Carrier Detect . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.10.03.00

   --- Version 1.00 Note:

   This parameter in the SHIP.CFG file determines if Carrier Detect on
   the modem should be watched. Universal Mayhem used to use WATCHCD
   for making its determination to see if a player hung up in the 
   middle of the program.

   If this value is 'NO', then Universal Mayhem will ignore the carrier
   detect on the com port that is described as one of the parameters in
   the .CFG file. This is useful when you want to run Universal Mayhem
   from the console.

   If this value is 'YES', then Universal Mayhem will check the status
   of the com port every time a character is needed from the modem. If
   carrier detect is not present, Universal Mayhem will display a
   small one-line notice to the modem and perform a structured bail out,
   closing all files, freeing up memory and such. The program will also
   exit with an ERRORLEVEL that indicates that carrier detect was lost.

   This means that WATCHCD is no longer needed with this version and
   future versions of Universal Mayhem.

Allow ANSI color to be used  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.10.04.00

   --- Version 1.00 Note:

   On of the parameters in the SHIP.CFG file determines if you want to
   allow ANSI color graphic sequences to be sent to the player. The
   player then gets to determine if he/she want to have ANSI color.

   The reason the SysOp was given the option of enabling/disabling
   the color availability was to give him or her a sense of power.

   No, actually, it's encase the majority of the players have older
   terminal programs that don't handle color graphic sequences as
   proposed by ANSI. PROCOMM PLUS handles it find, as does running the
   program from the console with ANSI.SYS installed.
 
Mayhem Statistics Feature  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.10.05.00

   --- Version 1.50 Note:

   To allow the Mayhem statistics to work, you must have the network mail
   enabled ('allow subspace messages' in the SHIP.CFG file) and have the
   statistics feature also enabled ('statistics feature', in the SHIP.CFG
   file). SEE THE Description on SHIP.CFG in this document.

              --- What is the statistics feature?

   If you have the statistics feature enabled, then the Mayhem program will
   scan your users data file once every Friday and compose a FidoNet message
   package addressed to me which contains the following information:

   o The network address of your system

   o How many active ships your system currently has

   o Information on your systems strongest power player:
     o The name of the player
     o The strength of the player (in terms of power)
     o Date and time the player was last active

   o Information on your systems highest planet ownership player:
     o The name of the player
     o The number of planets owned by that player
     o Date and time the player was last active

   o Information on your systems highest killer player:
     o The name of the player
     o The number of kills that player has
     o Date and time the player was last active

   This information, along with all other sites that wish to do the same, will
   be compiled by my system and placed into a file called STATS.SHP. This file
   is readable by the MAYHEM.EXE program which is the menu that's offered to
   each player upon shelling from the FidoNet BBS software. On Sunday of each
   week, my system will mail the statistics file STATS.SHP to your system,
   offer outbound mail packets, and poll your system for outbound subspace
   mail.

   I hope to be able to get other systems to call my system to perform the
   exchange, allowing me to put STATS.SHP as a file attach for pick-up. This
   will help defray my cost some and perhaps speed up the echo conference.

   If the statistics feature proves to be too much or is not desired by enough
   nodes, in deed, of the echo mail conference doesn't live well, it will be
   discontinued and something else, some other feature, will take its place.

                   --- When will it be available?

   The Statistics feature is available starting with version 1.50. I would
   like to know in advance if this is a good idea or not before I release it.

Address for Statistics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.10.06.00

   --- Version 1.50 Note:

   This is the network mailing address where the Statistics Feature message
   packets will be addressed to. It is usually me, but can be any valid
   network address.
 
BAD WORD Exclusion look-up file  . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.10.07.00

   --- Version 1.50 Note:

   The entry in the SHIP.CFG file that is described as a bad-word
   exclusion file is a file that you create and/or edit (as I will be
   sending one of my own with Mayhem starting at version 1.50) that is
   used to check the players typed-in entries for bad words. There
   are currently these aspects of player entered things that are
   checked:

      o Ships name
      o Ships password
      o Name of the player
      o Subspace messages subject and text

   If the players typed-in entry contains a word that is in the bad file
   exclusion list, then the player is told that the entry is unacceptable
   and is told to re-enter what ever it was that was being requested.

   Kevin from 128/74 wanted this; he is somewhat of a prude, huh?

   --- Version 2.0 Notes:

   The additions to the SHIP.CFG file made for version 2.0 are:

   c:\frontdoor\files    ;Where are the file attached files sent to
   c:\frontdoor\file\imports ;Where are received files to be found for statistics
   c:\frontdoor\mail     ;Where is your network mail directory located
   no                    ;Hold statistics message packets for pick up?
   Universal Mayhems West Coast Home 1:102/901.0 818-335-0128
   none                  ;Origin line for network mailed messages (stat files)
   21:00                 ;Can't page system operator after this (24 hour clock)
   08:00                 ;Can start paging SysOp after this (24 hour clock)
   no                    ;Are you running a Tandy computer?

   The 'Universal Mayhem West Coast Home' line is the * origin line used
   for the Echo Mail messages. Some mailers require Mayhem to add it. If
   you don't need to have Mayhem add the origin line, set this value to none.

   The 'none' that follows it is the origin line for the statistics feature
   packets. Since the value is 'none', network mail messages sent by Mayhem
   will not have an origin message applied to them.

Reset the computer automatically if Mayhem crashes . . . . 04.02.10.08.00

   --- Version 2.3 Notes:

   An addition for version 2.3: Reset the computer if Mayhem crashes.

   Universal Mayhem now has the ability to reset the computer if it crashes.
   It does this by tapping into the 18.2 clock-tick interrupt. Mayhem will
   reset a counter every time it performs various tasks. The clock-ticker
   will increment the the same counter. If the counter exceeds five minutes
   of clock ticks, then the keyboard is instructed to reset the computer.

   In order for this to work, your keyboard must be able to reset the computer.
   To find out if it can, perform the following from the DOS command line:

                       DEBUG           [return]
                       A               [return]
                       MOV     AL, FE  [return]
                       OUT     64, AL  [return]
                       JMP     104     [return]
                                       [return]
                       G=100           [return]

   Your computer should reset. If it does, then you can use this option. If
   it doesn't, then you'll just have to let Mayhem crash without a reset.
   If you run a system that has multiple DOS (or other) partitions, then you
   probably don't want to reset unless it resets only the crashed partition.

Redirection  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 04.02.11.00.00

   --- Version 1.40 Note:

   GATEWAY IS NO LONGER NEEDED FOR REDIRECTION! Finally and at last! The
   Universal Mayhem program will perform the redirection for itself and
   does not require Gateway or any other redirection program.

   When MAYHEM.EXE is run from the OPUS or FidoNet software, it will
   immediately check to see if a carrier is present on the com port. If
   it is present, then the program considers itself to be running from
   a BBS program and will redirect itself to the com port that is
   defined in SHIP.CFG.

   If the carrier is not present on the com port, then the program will
   consider itself to be running from the operators console and will not
   redirect itself out of the com port.

   In either case, redirected or not, the operators console has the same
   ability to see and enter characters just as the player does when the
   program is being re-directed.

   SHIP.EXE, which is invoked from MAYHEM.EXE, does exactly the same thing
   when it checks to see if it is being redirected. Some SysOps have the
   FidoNet BBS software go directly to SHIP.EXE and it was because of
   this that the effort was duplicated.

Maintenance  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 05.00.00.00.00

   Well, file SHIP.ERR and SHIP.LOG should be reviewed and deleted every
   now and then. Other than that, there isn't that much to do.

Network Mail . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 06.00.00.00.00

   Not totally tested in Beta Version, the subspace mail can be echo mail
   if you want. In any event, the message files created are according to
   OPUS file format and should be readable by the BBS programs as a
   specified message area.

   The origination and destination network address for the Echo Mail is
   defined in the configuration file: SHIP.CFG.

Network Version  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 07.00.00.00.00

   The Universal Mayhem program _will_ run on a network. Look for a file
   called NETWORK.ING with the distribution archive for additional
   details.

   Basically, however, Universal Mayhem was tested on a Novel Ethernet.
   It works well enough but you will not see other ships as they move
   through your area.

                                    - - -

   There _is_ a commercial version of Universal Mayhem which supports all
   networking capabilities, including the ability to see enemy ships that
   are active along with yours. You can actually fire at another human that
   is fighting back at another station.

   If interested, ask me about the commercial version.

Other Information  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Appendages .00

   A technical discussion of the enemy ships automation process: It's
   interesting to note how the ships are automated. There is what I like
   to call, a psudomultitasking operating system embedded in the
   Universal Mayhem package. Its bones consist of a rotational-singly-
   linked list of data structures in RAM that are allocated on an
   as-needed basis. As ships bail-out of automation for one reason or
   another, the RAM is de-allocated, making Universal Mayhems' memory
   allocation processes very tight and very non-wasteful in systems
   resources.

   The automation process is derived from the input routine which is
   usually where most of the programs process time is spent, waiting for
   a player to enter some command.

   A pointer to the first data structure is maintained and the last
   entry in the linked list points to the first. This makes is a circular
   linked list.

   During the multitasking time slice, the data structure being pointed to
   by the variable "m_run" is picked apart to determine if the ship that
   is described in the link list should attack, defend, assist, run-from,
   or bail-out. As the data is examined, the pointers to the functions to
   perform are invoked to automate the ships.

   During the next time slice, the pointer gets bumped forward somewhere
   in the linked list and the next ship in the list is automated.

   Testing in the past has shown, even on slow machines, an automation
   factor of well over 4000 automative moves processed by enemy ships every
   minute.

   This made the enemy ship movements too fast; more so when ships are
   attacking you as you sign in. They come from all the way across the
   universe and attack you. When you try to warp out, even at higher
   warps than the attacking ship, you can't get away from them and the
   player has NO TIME to defend.

   I changed this way of thinking and made the ship automation process VERY
   slow by widening the time slice segment allocated for the input routine
   and making the automation time slice segment very small. In addition,
   automated ships that are attacking can only operate at half of their
   warp capacity. When warping in to defend their bases, however, they are
   allowed to maintain top speed.

   - - -

   There are some interesting techniques and strategies which have been
   developed which I have watched at Astro-Net (103/903). Most centered
   around alliances; the ability to board each others bases, creating a
   string of thoughtfully placed community bases and attack swarms to keep
   enemy ships away.

   Fortunately, I have even seen differences in programming styles and
   wars fought over editors used, waged in the Universal Mayhem continuum.

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:

   When you attempt to warp into the center of the universe, you will
   notice that your ship will get bounced off of the center spot. This is
   because all ships are created at that spot and as such, stay at that
   location until they move. It was found that if a ship were to warp to
   the center spot and stay at that location, no ships could destroy it.

   --- Version 1.30 Note:

   In version 1.20, this command offered a little additional information
   which you might find interesting. It displayed the addresses of the
   linked list containing information on the command-file operated ships
   that have some declarative outstanding against or for your ship, the
   active ship.

   Though this information is worthless to the player and SysOp alike,
   its implementation was imperative for the programmer for detailed
   examination and testing of the command file structures to test for
   data integrity.

   Version 1.30 has this data dump of the linked list removed.

SYSOP  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 09.02.00.00.00

   The SYSOP activities are password protected and the password is found
   in the configuration file. ALWAYS change the password every week or so,
   mostly if you see repeated attempts to find it by looking at the SHIP.LOG
   file.

Removing unwanted/abandoned ships . . . . . . . . . . . . 09.02.01.00.00

   You may remove all destroyed or abandoned ships simply by requesting

   offer the four character name of the ship to remove.

Remove a specific ship . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 09.02.01.01.00

   If a specific ship is making you angry, why not remove it? This command
   will ask you for the name of the ship that should be removed. It will
   inform you that it's been done.

Move a base, ship, or return scout ships  . . . . . . . . 09.02.01.02.00

   You may move a ship, its base, or return all of a ships scout ships
   back to the ships on-board state.

   --- Version 1.50 Notes:

   The addition of the ability to return a ships scouts to on-board was
   added for testing of the scout functions and was kept in as it only
   cost about 200 bytes of code space.

Display a ships information  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 09.02.01.03.00

   This command will cause a 'STAT' command to be executed for the ship
   that you name. In addition, the ships password is also offered to the
   SysOp.

Expanding the users data file  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 09.02.02.00.00

   If you need to allow more players access to the system, this command
   will append empty record to the end of the SHIP.DAT file, keeping the
   contents of the original file intact.

   It's important to update the SHIP.CFG file if you use this command.

Suspension to DOS  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 09.02.03.00.00

   You may suspend do DOS remotely, allowing you to perform various
   activities directly to your system as though you were at the keyboard.
 
   I would strongly suggest that you read the warnings outlined in
   section (10.00.00.00.00), however, because suspension to DOS may cause
   all kinds of problems.

   When done, type "EXIT" at the prompt to return to Universal Mayhem.

   --- Version 1.30 Note:

   As an additional reminder when in a DOS shell from Universal Mayhem,
   I have added a 'enter "EXIT" to return to Universal Mayhem' string
   to your DOS prompt.

   What I will do is this:

   o See if there is an existing PROMPT defined in your environment

   o If there is

     o Change your DOS prompt to contain the reminder and your original
       DOS prompt, (This means that your original prompt is kept but
       you will get my reminder message before your prompt every time
       you hit enter).

     o Shell out to DOS

   o If there is no prompt string

     o I set your prompt to the reminder string, perform a new line, then
       create a prompt containing the drive number and directory path and
       then a > symbol).

     o Shell out to DOS

   o When you enter EXIT, Mayhem will:

     o Resume to execution at the SysOp menu, asking for an option

   It's quite interesting to notice that, since DOS creates a new shell
   and duplicates all of the environment strings, exiting Mayhem will
   cause the PROMPT variable to be automatically restored.

   If you shell out of mayhem and modify or remove any environment
   variables, the updates you make will not be permanent as when you
   type EXIT to return to Mayhem, the old shells environment table is
   restored.

   Kind of interesting... I noticed that Procomm, Procomm Plus, Procomm 
   Plus Test Drive, and Brief, to name a few, modify the PROMPT in the
   same manor to achieve a reminder prompt.

   --- Version 2.3 Note:

   If the 'Reset computer if Mayhem crashes' option is enabled in the
   SHIP.CFG file, a shell to DOS will first set the clock tick interrupt
   back to what it originally was and then shell to DOS.

   After the DOS is exited, Mayhem will check to see if the clock ticker
   has changed (by some other program run while the SysOp was shelled)
   and re-vector the clock ticker back into the Mayhem code so that it
   again will reset the computer while Mayhem is running.

   This is done so that the computer will not have the clock ticker time-out
   reset that Mayhem employs _while_ shelled to DOS. If the computer
   crashes while shelled (because the SysOp ran something), the computer
   will _not_ automatically reset after a minute.

Edit user power/credits/time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 09.02.04.00.00

   You may edit a players power, credits, and time remaining to play.
   This is useful if you want to restore a bug-related problem that
   allowed a ship to get too strong or play too long.

   Another use for it is to set the Galactic Police up as a very strong
   ship. Stronger than normal, allowing you the SysOp to set the power.

Taking planets away  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 09.02.05.00.00

   As a SysOp, you are allowed to take planets away from a player. This
   is normally only used if you detected a corrupted data file and
   need to clean up the planets ownerships without recreate of the
   universe file.

   When you remove a ship from the player file, all of its planets
   are handed over to the general universe use and are marked as not
   owned by anyone. These planets taxes goes towards the cops.

Remove all ships that have not moved . . . . . . . . . . . 09.02.06.00.00

   --- Version 1.50 Notes:

   A lot of times, players will shell to Mayhem from the BBS, create a
   ship, and then not move. It's not understood where to find instructions
   for the game and in a lot of cases, the game is simply too complicated
   to get moving right away.

   Callers will also not know where to download this file.

   Because of this, this command was added which will scan through the user
   data base and erase all ships that have been created but have not
   moved yet.

   As the program runs, you are informed of the names of the ships that
   have been removed.

Import remote players (Statistics feature) . . . . . . . . 09.02.07.00.00

   This option will cause Mayhem to execute a stand-alone program called
   UMREMOTE.EXE. This program will scan through the STATS.SHP file for
   all remote players that are in this file and will plug them into
   your systems player data file SHIP.DAT.

   For more information on the importation of remote players data records,
   see the 'Statistics Feature' description in section 04.02.10.05.00.

Warnings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.00.00.00.00

   While suspended to DOS, you should never run programs that write to the
   video screen memory directly. This will not be directed and you may not
   be able to see where you are in a program to get out of it.

   WATCHCD _should_ bail you out if you need to hang up but I would
   suggest that if you do suspend to DOS and get lost, drop carrier and
   then call your system back as soon as possible to make certain that
   the BBS software has reloaded and you are not still allow DOS access
   over your modem.

   I should mention that suspension to DOS does work and I have never been
   able to get the system to crash when used in a normal way, running
   programs that don't map directly to view RAM.

   TYPE, DEL, FORMAT: These all work. To make things a little more safe,
   you COULD rename a .COM file to TYPE.COM, DEL.COM, and FORMAT.COM such
   that if any unauthorized person DID get into your DOS, they would not
   be able to type anything, delete anything, or format anything because DOS
   will execute the .COM file first.

Getting destroyed  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.01.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   Well, it happens. If you are destroyed, you are asked for your ships
   password when you start the game and then will be informed of who
   destroyed your ship. You are then asked if you want to continue the
   game by starting over.

   In the older version, the ships password was overwritten with the name
   of the ship that destroyed you. This was done to save bytes from the
   disk file but that was determined to be silly... Another five bytes
   for the ships name is well worth the clean was that ships are restarted
   after being destroyed.

   If you noticed, if you sign in as a destroyed ship in the older version,
   you don't need to give a password. This is a bug I never fixed in that
   version and really should have.

CREATE.EXE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.00.00.00.00

   This is the program that creates the universe. It's a stand alone
   program that you run with the modem turned off or the phone off the
   hook, (never leave the phone off the hook too long; the central office
   equipment remains in-use and ties up a lot of equipment. The tone
   generator software that drives the hundreds of CO loop lines _can_
   get bogged down if we all leave the phone off the hook).

   The program will write over an existing universe so you need not
   delete an old one if you are changing the size of the universe.

   The program will ask you the following question:

   1) Allow planets to have names
   2) Do NOT allow planets to be named

   The program will tell you the amount of disk space you would save if
   you choose option 2. The savings in disk space is because each name
   is 16 bytes long. Multiplied by the XSIZE value which is further
   multiplied by 4 is a LOT of disk space.

   Consider a universe that is 10,000 by 10,000 sectors.

   10000 * 16 * 4 = 640,000 bytes or about 1/2 the size of the
   PLANETS.DAT file.

   Allowing players to name their commerce planets adds a certain amount
   of fun to the game and should be allowed if you have the disk space
   available. The option was created because MOST of the FidoNet SysOps
   have drives that are totally crammed to the edges with echo mail.

   After answering this question, the program will go on to create the
   UNIVERSE.DAT file and the PLANETS.DAT file. It will then link the
   black holes in the universe to white holes.

   Actually, only a percentage of the black holes are linked. It's in
   the linking phase that the time consumption is noticed. I have seen
   that on my old AT, running some 6 MHZ, a universe of 10,000 by 10,000
   takes about five minutes to create.

MAYHEM.EXE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12.00.00.00.00

   This program is the main menu that gets called from the batch file
   that is called from the BBS software. It offers the player the
   following options:

   1) Run Universal Mayhem
   2) Get run-down of the game
   3) Where is the documentation
   4) View latest updates
   5) Return to the BBS software

   At MAYHEM.EXE execution, file SHIP.SCR is read and displayed. This is
   the Universal Mayhem Logo, (which has been copy written as a trade mark,
   even though its a non-commercial copy right).

   IF YOU DON'T WANT this screen, simply put what ever you want into the
   file or just delete it.

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:

   When the Universal Mayhem logo is being displayed (SHIP.SCR file) when
   the game first starts, the user (player) may hit 's', escape, or
   control C to stop the display.

   - 1 Run Universal Mayhem -

      This option will execute the program SHIP.EXE. After execution, the
      program will return directly to the BBS software, bypassing the
      MAYHEM.EXE program. Versions prior to 1.40 used to have SHIP.EXE
      executed as a child process to MAYHEM.EXE at this and allowed the
      MAYHEM.EXE process to maintain watch over its child. In version 1.40,
      we simply spawn the new process thus overwriting the SHIP.EXE in
      memory. This gives Mayhem and any other task that may be a TSR an
      additional 100,240 bytes of free memory space!

   - 2 Get Run-down -

      The run-down is a file called SHIP.INF. When this option is requested,
      the contents of this file is dumped to the screen and/or modem.

      The player may terminate the run-down by entering "END" when the
      program pauses to await carriage return.

   - 3 Where is documentation -

      This option tells the player the files area number and title of where
      to find the MAYHEM.DOC file, (this one, in fact). This information is
      contained in the SHIP.INF file as the VERY FIRST LINE. It would look
      something like this:

      Area 3 - Universal Mayhem Files

      If the file is not locate-able, then the player will get a message
      informing them that the file could not be located and that the
      documentation is unavailable.

   - 4 View latest updates -

      This information is contained in a file called LASTUPDT.SHP. The file
      is created by the author Fredric Rice and is mailed out with program
      updates.

      It allows players to immediately know when Universal Mayhem has changed
      and something new has been done. The menu will display the date in
      the menu so that it's very easy to get all the update information.

   - 5 Return to BBS -

      This option will simply cause the returning to the BBS software.

   --- Version 1.30 Note:

   Option 5, (Return to BBS), has been moved to option number 6. Option
   5 has been replaced and the menu is now:

      1) Run Universal Mayhem
      2) Get run-down of the game
      3) Where is the documentation
      4) View latest updates
      5) Display top ten ships
      6) Return to the BBS software

   - 5 Display top ten ships

   The new option will allow players to view the standings of all of the
   players without needing to get all the way into Universal Mayhem to
   do so. It provides a fast way to check up on the game status, then.

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:

   When the Universal Mayhem logo is being displayed (SHIP.SCR file) when
   the game first starts, the user (player) may hit 's', escape, or
   control C to stop the display.

LASTUPDT.SHP . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.00.00.00.00

   This file contains a description of the latest updates I have made.
   The file should _not_ be updated by the SysOp because it belongs to
   me! The first line is the date of the last update and the remaining
   usually describes various updates.

   You should note that if this file does not exist, MAYHEM.EXE will run
   just fine, no problem. The option on the menu will simply say that no
   update information exists.

   You should remove the lastupdt.shp file every now and then, usually
   after everyone has had a chance to read it.

SHIP.HLP . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14.00.00.00.00

   This file contains the on-line help that players may pull up while in
   the Universal Mayhem game. You may edit this file so long as you take
   care and read the first section of the file to see how it's format is.

   If the file is missing, the HLPxx commands will NOT work.

SHIP.ERR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15.00.00.00.00

   This file contains a log of errors if they occurs. Usually, when you
   want to report a bug, you send this file to me at:

SHIP.LOG . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16.00.00.00.00
 
   This file contains a log of players sign-ins. More importantly, it also
   keeps a log of attempts to access the SYSOP command. This is so that you
   can see if someone make repeated attempts to get into the system.

GOALS.DAT  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16.01.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   This file, which MUST be only 60 bytes long, contains the location
   of each of the ten parts to the slaver death weapon. In addition, it
   keeps track of who owns them.

SHIP.INF . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16.02.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.30 Note: (Documentation only)

   This file contains a very important piece of information:  

   The first line of this file is used by the MAYHEM.EXE file to find
   the directory on your disk where this document file can be found.
   When a player selects the option which tells what directory this
   documentation file can be found, it reads the first line of the file
   SHIP.INF and displays it.

   It's important that this files first line be changed to reflect the
   file area containing universal Mayhems document file. Make sure it's
   the first line in the program.

SHIP.STD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16.03.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.3 Note:

   A new option from the MAYHEM.EXE file is the display of the players
   standings. The way this is done is that MAYHEM.EXE simply dumps this
   file to the users screen.

   This allows the players to view the standings without having to get
   into Universal Mayhem and then back out again after looking at the
   standings.

ECHOSTAT.DAT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16.04.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.50 Note:

   This file contains the date and time that statistics has been compiled
   by Mayhem for your system and a mail packet has been created. It is
   maintained so that when Friday comes around, Mayhem will know if it
   has already created a statistics package.

   It works this way:

      o When Mayhem is run, the program checks to see if it is Friday

      o If it is Friday, it checks the current date against what's in
        the ECHOSTAT.DAT file.

      o If the dates are different, Mayhem will compile statistics on
        your players and create a message file that's usually sent to
        me.

How to bounce a player . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17.00.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.42 Notes:

   When a player is active and you want to bounce the player, simply
   hit control B for Bounce!

How to report active player name . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18.00.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.42 Notes:

   You can see the name of the active ship, the ship captains name,
   the number of times signed in, and the number of minutes remaining
   to play, simply hit control U for User!

How to invoke chat mode  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18.01.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.42 Notes: Addition:

   Yes! You may finally CHAT with that PLAYER! All you need to to use
   the chat mode is (Finally :-}):

   Control T for TALK
   Control E for End talk!

   The standard time-out values are used; that is to say, inactivity from
   the keyboard or serial line for a certain duration will cause Mayhem
   to exit even if you are in chat mode. Indeed, chat mode is terminated
   after the FIRST inactivity warning.

CHAT command . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18.01.01.00.00

   --- Version 1.42 Notes:

   You may page the SysOp to request a chat. The System Operator can see
   who you are and hit control-T to start the chat mode. The SysOp can
   then hit control-E to end the chat mode.

   This command will actually page the system operator by ringing its
   bell. It will also offer the SysOp a written message every minute,
   letting it be known that you wish to talk. The command, then, need
   only be invoked once as the operators console will display your
   request to talk once a minute without you knowing it.

   --- Version 2.0 Notes:

   Enough comments have been made about the availability of the SysOp for
   being chatted to. There is now a timer value, actually a range of time,
   defined in the SHIP.CFG file that describes the hours when the SysOp
   may be paged.

INTERRUPT Driven Serial I/O  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18.01.02.00.00

   --- Version 2.3 Note:

   INTERRUPTED SERIAL I/O! Hey!

   Now, Mayhem will get interrupted every time a character is received by the
   serial port and the character will get stuffed into a 1K buffer. Mayhem will
   look at the buffer later but what this means is that the player now has a
   TYPE-AHEAD-BUFFER of 1K!!!

   The routines came from Tony Tribelli from Telcom Technologies and required
   very little modification to work well. Indeed, the only thing removed was
   the programming of the serial chip. Mayhem likes to leave the baud rate
   alone when it gets loaded...

   Anyway, the FREE command will tell you if Mayhem is running as an
   interrupted serial or as a polled (old versions were always polled).

   Now players can upload a file to Mayhem if they want!

   Thanks, Tony.

ERRORLEVEL meanings  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19.00.00.00.00

   Universal Mayhem will terminate with a number of useful errorlevels,
   allowing your batch files to operate more intelligently than would
   normally occurs. Here are the levels, (values), and what they mean:

   ERRORLEVEL	Meaning
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	0	Normal termination, no errors, bye bye message was given
	1	Normal termination, no errors, no bye bye message given
       10	Something went wrong. SHIP.ERR will have the error number
       41	Operator bounced player.
       42	Subspace mail was sent <--- When to toss mail is flagged
       50	Keyboard timed out <--- When to reset modem and hang up
       51	SHIP.CFG file was either bad or incomplete
       52	File is missing or can't be created <--- Out of space?
       53	Too many players already signed in
       61	System received non-maskable interrupt <--- Hardware
       62	An abort occurred <--- Hardware
       63	Floating Point Exception occurred
       64	Illegal instruction encountered <--- SHIP.EXE corrupted?
       65	Memory Segment Violation
       66	Terminal Error
       90       CARRIER DETECT has been lost, Mayhem exit.


   Some of the more notable errorlevels are described here:

   41		Operator had bounced player. Your batch file could take
		this value and reset the system completely if you want to
		have access to the system without allowing the player to
		be bounced to the BBS software. This would make the
		termination of call bypassing the BBS return making the
		call drop faster than allowing the return to BBS and then
		asking _it_ to drop the modem.

   42		Rather than have your batch file scan/toss any subspace mail
		that _may_ have been sent, your batch file could look for
		this value and toss mail if it finds it. It's important to
		note that if mail is sent by the player and an error
		occurs, the error will be returned in favor of the mail
		value. Only when no error occurred and mail was sent will
		an error level of 42 be returned.

   50		The keyboard timed out. After three minutes of inactivity,
		the player will get a warning, beeping the terminal and
		causing a one-line message to be displayed. At the end of
		an additional minute, Universal Mayhem will terminate with
		this errorlevel. This allows your batch file to reset the
		system by invocation of AUTOEXEC.BAT, for example, to reset
		the system. otherwise, for an inactive caller, Universal
		Mayhem would time out after four minutes, return to the BBS
		software where it would take an additional length of time
		for it to time out before hanging the inactive caller.

   61-66	The errorlevels 61 through 66 are usually an artifact of
		hardware problems. I have never seen any of these occurs
		yet I don't have a system that stays up 24 hours a day and
		has millions of people calling it every day. These type of
		errors _should_ be trapped and handled in a civilized
		manor allowing your system to be reset if they occurs.


   Of course, you need not check for _any_ of these in your batch file which
   invokes Universal Mayhem. They may, however, save you a lot of grief if
   you walk in from work at the meat packing plant to find your system hung.

   When any of these errors occur, the file SHIP.ERR will be updated to
   reflect a different error message value that _I_ use to determine the
   cause. Normally, I need this information to track down bugs but I have
   a list here that you may view just encase you can find the problem.
   Look in section 15.01.00.00.00 for these error codes.

*.SHP files  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20.00.00.00.00

   When you see files with this extension, other than the LASTMSG.SHP
   file, it is a command file that automates the players ships. They are
   not normally seen by the player or needed to be considered by the
   SYSOP as when a ship is destroyed, the file goes with it.

   The information contained within these files are english and may be
   typed and read as you desire. It was originally intended that the player
   could create one of these files and upload it to the Universal Mayhem
   directory, thus allowing them to maintain a command file at home and
   uploading it before sign-in off or something. This was never allowed but
   the files remained ascii text just the same.

   --- Version 1.50 Note:

   The LASTMSG.SHP file is not used any more.

Memory requirements  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21.00.00.00.00

   Universal Mayhem takes about 158K of memory. The development system
   has 640K or ram and I have had two copies of Universal Mayhem resident
   at the same time as the X00 FOSSIL driver, GATEWAY2, and Norton
   guides. To get the second copy of Universal Mayhem resident, I used the
   SYSOP function of suspension to DOS which further brought in an additional
   copy of COMMAND.COM. To see the amount of memory left, I used RMAP,
   a public domain program, to see what the memory remaining was. Finally,
   I suspended to DOS and used RMAP.

   With all this resident, I had a remaining 48K of RAM. Skimming the
   objects off the RAM to return to the original copy of Universal Mayhem
   in memory worked with no problem. Taking Norton Guides out of memory
   worked as did the removal of the second copy of Mayhem and the
   COMMAND.COM's.

   What I'm trying to say is: Universal Mayhem is not a RAM hog. It is a
   disk space hog.

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   Thanks should be in order for Captain Bob Campbell who offered a
   solution to the disk space requirements thereby cutting the size of
   the universe and planets files by more than half. A universe of
   10000 by 10000 uses 380K or so where it would normally have taken
   some 1.7 megabytes! This reduction is a heavy requirement in FidoNet
   where Echo Mails takes up five meg every night!

When a BIG Universe is created . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21.01.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.30 Note:   (Documentation only)

   A universe of 32000 by 32000 was created on an XT running 8 MHZ.
   A total of 100 players was defined in the SHIP.CFG file.
   The following information on system usage is reported:

   It took 22 minutes to create the universe
   The Universe file was 512K (and 16 bytes)
   The Planets file was 640K
   The players file was 68K (and 800 bytes)
   The goals file is always 50 bytes
   The comets file is always 1160 bytes

   The total disk space used: 1,222,026 (One megabyte)

   The universe size: 1,024,000,000 sectors (One billion, 24 million!)

   At maximum warp, it took 4 minutes 23 seconds to traverse universe
   from lower right corner to upper left corner. At warp 10, it took
   twelve minutes 37 seconds and I encountered a black hole.

Sit around for awhile  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22.00.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   A battle ship to your left, a star cruiser to your right. An enemy
   star base above you. What do you do? You sit and see what happens
   if you just sit their like an ass.

   I'll tell you what you should do. Sit and see what happens for a
   few minutes. If you're still alive after awhile, you'll know.

Somethings for the SysOp to watch  . . . . . . . . . . . . 23.00.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.00 Notes:

   There have been several comments, four in fact, that Universal Mayhem
   is raw-thare boring to watch from the SysOp standpoint. A good point...
   I have added something that might make it a little interesting, at
   least for a little while:

   As you watch a player running Mayhem from the modem, you are able to
   watch enemy ships either converging or running from that player. This
   is done whenever a ships command file takes over and a ship moves;
   you are told what ship moves from where to where. This allows you to
   watch allied ships, perhaps, converge on a helpless ship and get to
   see it blown to shit.

   There are other things reported that only you the SysOp can see when
   a player is running from the modem. Among them is being able to see
   what the cops buy when a player pays taxes. Why not? It's something
   to look at instead of a warp sequence that takes fifteen minutes!

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:

   When the active players scout ships move, the system operator is told
   when it moves and if gets to its station. This information is offered
   to the system operator at the computers console and is not seen by the
   players.

Multi-Universe Mayhem Version 1.4  . . . . . . . . . . . . 24.00.00.00.00

   --- Version 1.40 Notes:

   Universal Mayhem has gone to a multi-universe format. It basically
   takes the form of a three dimensional Mayhem but without a visual
   indication nor a mechanic sensory aspect into the alternate
   dimensions.

   You still have the normal X-Y coordinate system that you're used to.
   What you also have now is an additional Z coordinate for the
   following items:

   Your ship
   Your Base
   Your attack swarms
   Your remote sensors
   Your scout ships
   The universal slaver death weapons

   If you want to pick up a remote you left in universe 9 and you are
   in universe 6, you must traverse the various universes through the
   gates that exist to enter universe 9. Once there, a normal warp and
   pick up can be made.

Multi-Universe Map . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24.00.00.00.01

   The Multi-Universe looks like this:

   Suppose you are in universe 6 and need to get to universe 9. You would,
   according to the above map, choose a route. Any way you choose, you 
   must go through FIVE universes to make the trip. Let's choose the
   following route:

   From 6 to 2 to 0 to 3 to 8 and then to 9. In universe 6 you would warp
   to the lower right corner of the universe, enter the gate going to
   universe 2. Once their, warp to the lower left hand corner of universe
   2 and enter the gate going into universe 0, (the default universe).
   Once their, enter the gate leading to universe 3, (no warping is needed
   because it's a lower left gateway). Once in universe 3 warp to the
   lower right corner of the universe into gateway 8. Once their warp to
   the lower left corner into universe gateway 9. Once their, warp to
   where your remote is and pick it up!

   --- Version 2.0 Notes:

   Scott Neville, Australia, is hosting Universal Mayhem down under. The
   network node assignment adopted by Scott is 11:9000/0. The phone number
   for his site is 011-61-3-560-9292.

   Scott has consented to acting as a secondary star for his part of the
   world and will bundle up Area Mayhem Echo Conference messages for
   eventual pick up and distribution in the states.

   Thanks, Scott!
